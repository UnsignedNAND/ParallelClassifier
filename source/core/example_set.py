April is the fourth [[month]] of the [[year]], and comes between [[March]] and [[May]]. It has 30 [[day]]s. April begins on the same day of week as [[July]] in all years and also [[January]] in leap years.

April's [[flower]]s are the [[Sweet Pea]] and [[Asteraceae|Daisy]]. Its [[birthstone]] is the [[diamond]]. The meaning of the diamond is innocence.

== The Month ==
[[File:Colorful spring garden.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Spring]] flowers in April in the [[Northern Hemisphere]].]]
April comes between [[March]] and [[May]], making it the fourth month of the year. It also comes first in the year out of the four months that have 30 days, as [[June]], [[September]] and [[November]] are later in the year. It starts on the same day of the week as [[July]] every year, and starts on the same day as [[January]] in [[leap year]]s. In a [[common year]], April starts on the same day of the week as [[October]] of the previous year, and in [[leap year]]s starts on the same day as [[May]] of the previous year.
April ends on the same day of the week as [[December]] every year. In a [[common year]], it ends on the same day as [[July]] of the previous year. In a [[leap year]], it ends on the same day as [[October]] of the previous year.

April is a [[spring]] month in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] and an [[autumn|autumn/fall]] month in the [[Southern Hemisphere]]. In each [[hemisphere]], it is the [[season]]al equivalent of [[October]] in the other.

It is unclear as to where April got its name. A common theory is that it comes from the [[Latin]] word "aperire", meaning "to open", referring to [[flower]]s opening in [[spring]]. Another theory is that the name could come from [[Aphrodite]], the Greek goddess of [[love]]. It was originally the second month in the old Roman [[Calendar]], before the start of the new year was put to [[January 1]].

Quite a few festivals are held in this month. In many [[Southeast Asia]]n cultures, new year is celebrated in this month (including [[Songkran]]). In Western [[Christianity]], [[Easter]] can be celebrated on a [[Sunday]] between [[March 22]] and [[April 25]]. In [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Christianity, it can fall between [[April 4]] and [[May 8]]. At the end of the month, Central and Northern [[Europe]]an [[culture]]s celebrate [[Walpurgis Night]] on [[April 30]], marking the transition from [[winter]] into [[summer]].

== April in poetry ==
[[poetry|Poets]] use ''April'' to mean the end of winter. For example: ''April showers bring [[May]] flowers.''

August is the eighth [[month]] of the [[year]] in the [[Gregorian calendar]], coming between [[July]] and [[September]]. It has 31 [[day]]s, the same number of days as the previous month, [[July]], and is named after Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]].

== The Month ==
[[File:Hw-augustus.jpg|thumb|120px|right|Roman Emperor [[Augustus Caesar]], after whom August is named]]
This month was first called ''[[Sextilis]]'' in [[Latin]], because it was the sixth month in the old [[Roman calendar]]. The Roman calendar began in March about 735 BC with [[Romulus and Remus|Romulus]]. [[October]] was the eighth month. August was the eighth month when January or February were added to the start of the year by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700 BC. Or, when those two months were moved from the end to the beginning of the year by the [[decemvirs]] about 450 BC (Roman writers disagree). In [[153 BC]] [[January 1]] was determined as the beginning of the year.

August is named for [[Augustus Caesar]] who became [[Roman consul]] in this month.<ref name="infoplease">{{Citation |title=History of August |url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/history-of-august.html }}</ref>  The month has 31 days because [[Julius Caesar]] added two days when he created the [[Julian calendar]] in [[45 BC]]. August is after July and before September.

August, in either [[hemisphere]], is the seasonal equivalent of [[February]] in the other. In the [[Northern hemisphere]] it is a [[summer]] month and it is a [[winter]] month in the [[Southern hemisphere]]. In a [[common year]], no other month begins on the same day of the week as August, though in [[leap year]]s, [[February]] starts on the same day as August. August always ends on the same day of the week as [[November]].

August's flower is the [[Gladiolus]] with the birthstone being [[peridot]]. The astrological signs for August are Leo ([[July 24]] - [[August 22]]) and Virgo ([[August 23]] - [[September 23]]).

Austria ({{lang-de|Österreich}}; officially called Republic of Austria),
is a country in [[Central Europe]]. Around Austria there are [[Germany]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Slovenia]], [[Italy]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. Currently, the chancellor is [[Werner Faymann]]. Austria has been a [[state|member-state]] of the [[European Union|EU]] since [[1995]].

The people in Austria speak [[German language|German]], a few also [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The capital of Austria is [[Vienna]] (Wien).

Austria is more than a thousand years old. Its history can be followed to the [[ninth century]]. At that time the first people moved to the land now known as Austria. The name "Ostarrichi" is first written in an official document from [[996]]. Since then this word has developed into the Modern German word ''Österreich,'' which literally means "East Kingdom."

Austria is a democratic state and has nine federal states ({{lang-de|''Bundesländer''}}): [[Vorarlberg]], the [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]], [[Salzburg]], [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]], [[Styria]], [[Upper Austria]], [[Lower Austria]], [[Vienna]] and [[Burgenland]]. It is a [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] state, that means it does not take part in wars with other countries. Austria has been in the [[United Nations]] since 1955 and in the [[European Union]] since 1995.

== History ==
=== Ancient times ===
There has been human settlement in the area that is now Austria for a long time. The first settlers go back to the Paleolithic age. That was the time of the [[Neanderthal]]s. They left works of art such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]]. In the Neolithic age people were living there to dig for [[mineral]] resources, especially [[copper]]. [[Ötzi the Iceman|Ötzi]], a [[mummy]] found in a [[glacier]] between Austria and Italy, is from that time. In the [[Bronze Age]] people built bigger settlements and fortresses, especially where there were [[mineral]] resources. [[Salt mine|Salt mining]] began near [[Hallstatt]]. At that time, [[Celt]]s began to form the first states.

=== The Romans ===
[[File:Austria Romana.png|left|thumb|Map]]
====The Roman cities and their modern names====
The Romans came 15 B.C. to Austria and made the Celtic Regnum Noricum to a province. Modern Austria was part of three provinces, Raetia, Noricum and Pannonia. The border in the north was the Danube.

        title='Boot device',
        text='''
        A boot device is used to start a [[computer]].  It is named after a [[boot]] which fits on the [[foot]].  The word [[bootstrap]] is also closely related, and means, to use something simpler to get something more complex to make itself work better. It comes from the English phrase "pull yourself up by your own bootstraps."

Before a computer can operate normally, it must have [[operating system]] instructions that tell it how to perform basic functions.  A boot device loads the operating system into the [[memory]] of the computer. 

Devices that can boot a computer are usually boot disks or boot drives 
(normally a [[hard drive]], but can be a [[floppy disk]] or a [[compact disk|CD]]).  Some [[network computer]]s use ''boot chips'' that get the [[operating system]] over a [[network]].  [[Web phone]]s also use such chips to identify the user to the [[cell network]].  Boot card standards may let many users boot [[kiosk computer]]s with full [[privacy]] and access to all [[applications]] they own. There are also boot boards or boot ''add-in'' cards that are more permanent than boot cards.

Some people refer to the boot device as just a boot and non-boot devices as data devices, although it is not the [[computer]] but the [[operating system]] that cares about the difference between these.

==Origin==
The boot in boot device is the same as [[booting]] (or starting up). This is short for bootstrapping, or to start with simple stuff and make complex stuff out of it.

Brazil (officially called Federative Republic of Brazil; how to say: {{IPA2|bɾɐˈziw}}) is a [[country]] in [[South America]]. It is the [[earth|world]]'s fifth largest country. The country has about 201 million people. The [[capital (city)|capital]] of Brazil is [[Brasília]]. Brazil was named after [[brazilwood]]. Brazilwood is a tree that once grew very well along the Brazilian coast.<ref name="Fausto1999">{{cite book|author=Boris Fausto|title=A Concise History of Brazil|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HJdaM325m8IC&pg=PA9|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-56526-4|page=9}}</ref>

== History ==
The first people to come to Brazil came around 9,000 B.C.{{cn}} That group of people is often called the South American Indians.  They probably came from [[North America]]. Some of them were hunters and gatherers, but others were farmers.<ref name="Britannica">{{citeweb|url=http://school.eb.com/levels/high/article/106094 |title=Brazil |website=Britannica School |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica |accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>

[[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] was the first European to see Brazil. He saw it in 1500. He was from [[Portugal]] and the Portuguese government claimed Brazil. Soon, explorers explored the whole coastline of Brazil and colonies were set up. In the late 1500s and early 1600s the Dutch and the French would sometimes try to take land in Brazil. Brazilians started moving inland farther than the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] said they could. This caused some fights with the Spaniards and native people in the area.<ref name="Britannica" />

In 1822, Brazil claimed to be its own country and not a part of [[Portugal]] anymore. Soon there was [[civil war]]. But the emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] improved the economy, and in 1888, he freed the [[slavery|slaves]]. In 1889, there was a military [[coup]] and Pedro II had to leave the country.<ref name="Britannica" />

In 1889, Brazil became a [[republic]]. It was not very democratic, because the only people who could vote were people who owned land. There were some uprisings in the 1920s because some people thought the government was unfairly helping coffee growers. Brazil joined the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] during [[World War II]].<ref name="Britannica" />

During the 1960s, the leader [[Castelo Branco]] made the government like a [[dictatorship]]. Since then, the country has become more democratic, but some people feel that there are still big problems in health and education.  Brazil will be hosting the 2016 olympics.

==Languages==
Most people in Brazil speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Brazil is the only country in Latin America that speaks [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].

Some people in Brazil speak [[German language|German]] dialects. That came from German immigrants. 0.8% of Brazilians speak German as their [[first language]].

Other people in Brazil speak indigenous Brazilian languages, [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[French language|French]], or [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[Guaraní language|Guaraní]] and [[Aymara language|Aymará]] are the first languages of a small number of Brazilians.

== Geography ==
Brazil has the world's largest [[rainforest]], the [[Amazon Rainforest]]. It makes up 40% of the country's land area. Brazil also has other types of land, including a type of [[savanna]] called ''cerrado'', and a dry plant region named ''caatinga''.

The most important cities are [[Brasília]] (the capital), [[Belém (Brazil)|Belém]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Curitiba]], [[Florianópolis]], [[Fortaleza (Brazil)|Fortaleza]], [[Goiânia]], [[Manaus]], [[Porto Alegre]],  [[Recife]], [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[São Paulo]] (the biggest city) and [[Vitória (Brazil)|Vitória]].  Other cities are at [[List of largest cities in Brazil]].

Brazil is divided into 26 states plus the Federal District in five regions (north, south, northeast, southeast and centre-west):
*North: Acre, Amazonas, Rondônia, Roraima, Pará, Amapá, Tocantins
*Northeast: Maranhão, Pernambuco, Ceará, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia
*Centre-West: Goiás, Mato grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul, Distrito Federal/ Federal District
*Southeast: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Espírito Santo, Minas Gerais
*South: Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul

The country is the fifth largest in the world by area. It is known for its many rainforests and jungles. It is next to every country in South America except [[Chile]] and [[Ecuador]].

== People/culture ==

Brazil is the largest country in [[South America]] and the largest economy in [[Latin America]]. Its people include people of [[Portugal|Portuguese]] or other [[Europe]]an descent, [[Africa]]n descent, and [[Indigenous peoples|native Amerindians]], as well as many people of [[Mulatto|mixed origins]]. Brazil also has the biggest number of [[Japan]]ese descendents outside Japan. 

People from Brazil are called ''Brazilians''<ref>{{cite web |url= http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=brazilian |title=WordNet Search - 3.0 |work=wordnetweb.princeton.edu |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref> (''brasileiros'' in Brazilian Portuguese language).

        [[File:Chemicals in flasks.jpg|thumb|200px|Chemistry is the science of ''chemical elements'' and ''compounds''.]]
Chemistry is a branch of  [[science]] that deals with [[chemical element]]s and [[Chemical compound|compounds]], and how these things work together. It is the study of the [[material]]s (things) that make up our bodies and everything in the [[world]] around us.

==History==
Before 1600, people studied substances to figure out how to do things such as turn lead into gold, but no one managed to do that. This was called alchemy. Alchemists (people that did alchemy) did discover some useful things, though. Sulphuric acid and nitric acid were two substances that they discovered.
Only a few elements were known. Some of them are mercury, silver, gold, and carbon.

Chemistry began as a true science during the 1600s. This is when chemists discovered the simplest [[substance]]s that make up all other substances. These simple substances are called elements. One of the things that they learned is that gold and lead are two different elements, so you can not change one into the other by a chemical reaction. The first element discovered after 1600 was [[phosphorus]], a strange white glowing solid.

Elements were discovered more and more rapidly. People separated the air into many parts and isolated the [[noble gas]]es from it. They also processed special minerals from a mine in [[Sweden]] to get [[rare earth metal]]s. [[Radioactivity]] was also discovered. Today chemists have discovered 118 different elements. Some are very common, like [[oxygen]]. Many are very rare and expensive, like [[platinum]]. Some cannot be found on earth and can only be made in labs, like [[rutherfordium]].

Since the 1920s, the increased understanding of [[physics]] has changed chemists' [[theory|theories]] about [[chemical reaction]]s.  With smaller and faster [[computer]]s, chemists have built better tools for [[Analytical chemistry|analyzing]] substances. These tools have been sent to study chemicals on [[Mars]].  Police also use those tools to study [[evidence]] from [[crime]] [[wikt:scene|scene]]s.

==Types of chemistry==
There are several types of chemistry. [[Analytical chemistry]] looks at which  chemicals are in things. For example, looking at how much [[arsenic]] is in food. [[Organic chemistry]] looks at things that have [[carbon]] in them. For example, making [[acetylene]]. [[Inorganic chemistry]] looks at things that do not have carbon in them. One example is making an [[integrated circuit]].

A large area of chemistry is [[polymer chemistry]]. This looks at plastics. One example is making [[nylon]]. Because plastics are made of carbon, polymer chemistry is part of organic chemistry. Another area is [[biochemistry]]. This looks at the chemistry of living things. An example would be seeing how [[arsenic]] poisons people. Biochemistry is also part of organic chemistry. There are many other small branches of chemistry.                  

==[[wikt:concept|Concepts]] of chemistry==
===Basic concepts===
The basic unit of an [[Chemical element|element]] is called an [[atom]]. An atom is the smallest building block that you can cut an element into without the element breaking down (turning into a lighter element, for example through [[nuclear fission]] or [[radioactive decay]]). A [[chemical compound]] is a [[substance]] made up of two or more elements. In a compound, two or more atoms are joined together to form a [[molecule]]. The tiniest speck of dust or drop of [[liquid]], that one can see is made up of many millions or billions of these molecules. [[Mixture]]s are [[substance]]s where chemicals are mixed but not reacted. An example would be mixing sand and salt. This can be undone again to produce salt and sand separately. Chemical compounds are changed by a chemical reaction. An example would be heating [[sodium bicarbonate]], common baking soda. It will make water, [[carbon dioxide]], and [[sodium carbonate]]. This reaction cannot be undone.

===Mole===
A mole is a very large amount of atoms (602,214,150,000,000,000,000,000 atoms). The [[atomic mass]] of an element can be used to see how much of the element makes a mole. For example, the atomic mass of copper is about 63.55. That means about 63.55 [[gram]]s of copper metal has a mole of atoms. The atomic mass of chlorine is about 35.45. That means 35.45 grams of chlorine has a mole of atoms in it.

Moles can be used to see how many molecules are in chemical compounds, too. [[Copper(II) chloride]] is an example. CuCl<sub>2</sub> is its chemical formula. There is one copper atom (63.55) and two chlorine atoms (35.45 · 2 = 70.90). Add all the molar masses of the elements together and the molar mass of the chemical compound is gotten. (63.55 + 70.90 = 134.45) That means in 134.45 grams of copper(II) chloride, there is one mole of copper(II) chloride molecules. This concept is used to calculate how much chemicals are needed in a chemical reaction if no reactants (chemicals that are reacted) should be left. If too much reactant is used, there will be some reactants left in the chemical reaction.

===Acids and bases===
[[Acid]]s and [[base (chemistry)|bases]] are common chemicals. Acids release H<sup>+</sup> [[ion]]s when in water, and bases release [[Hydroxide|OH<sup>−</sup>]] ions when in water. Acids can react with bases. The H<sup>+</sup> ion is taken from the acid by the base. This makes water, H<sub>2</sub>O. A salt is also made when an acid and a base react together. An example would be reacting [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[sodium hydroxide]] (NaOH). Hydrochloric acid releases H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions in water. The base releases Na<sup>+</sup> and OH<sup>-</sup> ions. The H<sup>+</sup> and the OH<sup>-</sup> react to make water. There is a solution of [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl) left. Sodium chloride is a [[salt]]. 

==Usefulness==
Chemistry is very useful in everyday life and makes up the foundation of many branches of science. Most objects are made by chemists (people who do chemistry). Chemists are constantly working to find new and useful substances. Chemists make new [[Medicine|drugs]] and materials like [[paint]]s that we use every day.

==Safety==
[[File:Cyril Ponnamperuma analyzing a moon sample.jpg|thumb|200px|This chemist is wearing safety [[glasses]], a lab coat and [[glove]]s. He is looking at a rock from the [[moon]].]]
Many chemicals are harmless, but there are some chemicals that are dangerous. For example, [[mercury(II) chloride]] is very [[wikt:toxic|toxic]]. [[Chromate]]s can cause [[cancer]]. [[Tin(II) chloride]] pollutes water easily. [[Hydrochloric acid]] can cause bad burns. Some chemicals like [[hydrogen]] can explode or catch fire. To stay safe, chemists experiment with chemicals in a chemical lab. They use special equipment and clothing to do reactions and keep the chemicals contained. The chemicals used in [[Medicine|drugs]] and in things like [[bleach]] have been tested to make sure they are safe if used correctly.

Biology is the [[science]] of life and living things, and their  [[evolution]]. Living things include [[plants]], [[animals]], [[fungi]] (such as [[mushroom]]s), and [[microorganisms]] such as [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]].

People who study biology are called [[biologists]]. Biology looks at how animals and other organisms behave and work, and what they are like. Biology also studies how [[organism]]s react with each other and the [[environment]]. It has existed as a [[science]] for about 200 years, and was preceded by [[natural history]]. Biology has many [[research]] fields and [[branch]]es. Like all sciences, biology uses the [[scientific method]]. This means that biologists must be able to show [[evidence]] for their ideas, and that other biologists must be able to test the ideas for themselves.

Biology attempts to answer questions such as:
"What are the characteristics of this living thing?" ([[comparative anatomy]]);
"How do the parts work?" ([[physiology]]);
"How should we group living things?" ([[Biological classification|classification]], [[taxonomy]]);
"What does this living thing do?" ([[behaviour]], [[growth]]);
"How does [[inheritance]] work? ([[genetics]]); "What has been the history of life?" ([[palaeontology]]). How do organisms relate to their [[environment]]? ([[ecology]]). All modern biology is influenced by [[evolution]], which answers the question: "How has the living world come to be as it is?"

[[File:Desktop computer clipart - Yellow theme.svg|thumb|A drawing of a usual modern desktop computer.]]
A computer is a [[machine]] that is able to take information ([[Information|input]]), do some work on or make changes to the information, to make new information ([[output]]). Computers have existed for much of [[human]] [[history]]. Examples of early computers are the [[astrolabe]] and the [[abacus]]. 

Modern computers are very different from early computers. They are now very powerful machines that are able to do billions of calculations every second.   Most people have used a [[personal computer]] in their home or at work.  Computers are useful for many different jobs where [[automation]] is useful.  Some examples are controlling [[traffic light]]s, [[vehicle]] computers, security systems, [[washing machine]]s and digital televisions.

A person (called a user) can control a computer by telling it to do things.  Some ways of controlling a computer are with a [[keyboard (computer)|keyboard]], [[computer mouse | mouse]], buttons, [[touch screen]].  Some very new computers can also be controlled with voice commands or hand gestures.  

Computers can be designed to do anything with information.  Computers are used to control factories, which in the past were controlled by humans. They are also in homes, where they are used for things such as listening to music, reading the [[news]], and writing.

Modern computers are electronic machines. A computer is only useful if it has both hardware and software.  Hardware is the physical parts the computer is made of - for example keyboard, mouse, screen, tower, and the circuits inside it.   Software is the computer programs (mathematical instructions). The software uses the hardware, when the user gives it instructions and changing it in to useful output.  

Many modern computers do billions of calculations each second.   They do mathematical [[arithmetic]] very quickly but computers do not really "think".  They only follow the instructions in their software programs. 

Computer programs are designed or written by computer [[programmer]]s. A few programmers write programs in the computer's own language called [[machine code]]. Machine code has only a few instructions and is based on [[logic]] and [[arithmetic]].  Using machine code is difficult for most human programmers. 

Today, programs are commonly written using a [[programming language]] like [[C++]], [[Java programming language|Java]], and [[Python (programming language)|Python]].  These programming languages are more like the language you talk and write with every day. A program called a [[compiler]] translates the user's instructions into binary code (machine code) and turns it into useful information that a user can easily understand, and then the computer will understand the instructions and do what is needed.

== History of computers ==
[[File:Jacquard.loom.full.view.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Jacquard loom]] was one of the first programmable devices.]]

=== Definition ===
A computer is an electronic machine which helps in solving problems quickly and easily. It solves problems according to instructions given to it by the computer user. It is a digital machine used in all fields.

=== Automation ===
Humans have a problem with maths.  To show this, try doing 584 x 3,220 in your head.  It is hard to remember all the steps!  People made tools to help them remember where they were in a maths problem. The other problem people have is that they have to do the same problem over and over and over again.  A cashier used to make change every day in her head or with a piece of paper.  That took a lot of time and people made mistakes.  So people made machines that did those same things over and over. This part of computer history is called the "history of automated calculation," which is a fancy phrase for "the history of machines that make it easy for me to do this same maths problem over and over without making mistakes."

The [[abacus]], the [[slide rule]],  the [[astrolabe]] and the [[Antikythera mechanism]] (which dates from about 150-100 BC) are examples of automated calculation machines.

=== Programming ===
{{main|Computer programming}}
Some people did not want a machine that would do the same thing over and over again. For example, a music box is a machine that plays the same music over and over again. Some people wanted to be able to tell their machine to do different things. For example, they wanted to tell the music box to play different music every time. They wanted to be able to program the music box- to order the music box to play different music. This part of computer history is called the "history of programmable machines" which is a fancy phrase for "The history of machines that I can order to do different things if I know how to speak their language."

One of the first examples of this was built by [[Hero of Alexandria]] (c. 10–70 AD). He built a mechanical theater which performed a play lasting 10 minutes and was operated by a complex system of ropes and drums. These ropes and drums were the language of the machine- they told what the machine did and when. Some people argue that this is the first programmable machine.<ref>{{cite web

Historians disagree on which early machines are "computers". Many say the "castle clock", an [[astronomical clock]] invented by [[Al-Jazari]] in 1206, is the first known [[Computer programming|programmable]] [[analog computer]]. Others say the first computer was made by [[Charles Babbage]].<ref name="Ancient Discoveries">{{citation|title=Ancient Discoveries, Episode 11: Ancient Robots|publisher=History Channel|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxjbaQl0ad8|accessdate=2008-09-06}}</ref> [[Al - Jazari]]'s showed the [[zodiac]], the [[Heliocentric orbit|solar]] and [[lunar orbit]]s, a [[Lunar phase|crescent moon]]-shaped [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] travelling across a gateway that made some [[door]]s to open every [[hour]],<ref>Howard R.

=== The Computing Era ===

At the end of the [[Middle Ages]], people in Europe thought math and [[engineering]] were more important. In 1623, [[Wilhelm Schickard]] made a mechanical calculator.  Other Europeans made more calculators after him.  They were not modern computers because they could only add, subtract, and multiply- you could not change what they did to make them do something like play Tetris.  Because of this, we say they were not programmable. 

In 1801, [[Joseph Marie Jacquard]] used [[punch card|punched paper cards]] to tell his [[loom|textile loom]] what kind of pattern to weave. He could use punch cards to tell the loom what to do, and he could change the punch cards, which means he could program the loom to weave the pattern he wanted.  This means the loom was programmable. 

Mechanical calculation by machine was done by [[Charles Babbage]].  He wanted to make a machine that could do calculations.  [[Charles Babbage]]'s mechanical computer was called it "The Analytical Engine".<ref>Don't confuse the Analytical Engine with Babbage's [[difference engine]] which was a non-programmable mechanical calculator.</ref> Because Babbage did not have enough money and always changed his design when he had a better idea, he never built his Analytical Engine.

As time went on, computers got more and more popular.  And that stands out at the beginning. This is because people get bored easily doing the same thing over and over.  Imagine spending your life writing things down on index cards, storing them, and then having to go find them again.  The U.S. Census Bureau in 1890 had hundreds of people doing just that. People got very bored and very frustrated, and would say, "There HAS to be an easier way to do this." Then a clever person worked out how to make machines do a lot of the work. [[Herman Hollerith]] figured out how to make a machine that would automatically add up information that the Census bureau collected. The [[Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation]] (which later became [[IBM]]) made his machines, and everyone was happy. At least, they were happy until their machines broke down, got jammed, and had to be repaired. This is when the [[Computing Tabulating Recording Corporation]] invented tech support.  

Because of machines like this, new ways of talking to these machines were invented, and new types of machines were invented, and eventually the computer as we know it was born.

=== Analog and Digital Computers ===

In the first half of the 20th century, scientists started using computers, mostly because scientists had a lot of math to figure out and wanted to spend more of their time thinking about the secrets of the universe instead of spending hours adding numbers together. For example, if they had to launch a [[rocket ship]], they needed to do a lot of math to make sure the rocket did not blow up.

So they put together computers. These computers used [[analog signal|analog]] circuits, which made them very hard to program. Then, in the 1930s, they invented [[digital]] computers, which made them easier to program.  

=== High-scale computers ===

Scientists figured out how to make and use digital computers in the 1930s and 1940s.  Scientists made a lot of digital computers, and as they did, they figured out how to ask them the right sorts of questions to get the most out of them.  Here are a few of the computers they built: 

{{Early computer characteristics}}

[[File:EDSAC (10).jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[EDSAC]] was one of the first computers that remembered what you told it even after you turned the power off.  This is called ([[von Neumann architecture|von Neumann]]) architecture.]]
* [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Electromechanics|electromechanical]] "Z machines". The [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] (1941) was the first working machine that used [[Binary numeral system|binary]] arithmetic.  Binary arithmetic means using "Yes" and "No." to add numbers together.  You could also program it.  In 1998 the Z3 was proved to be [[Turing complete]].  Turing complete means that it is possible to tell this particular computer anything that it is mathematically possible to tell a computer.  It is the world's first modern computer.
* The non-programmable [[Atanasoff–Berry Computer]] (1941) which used vacuum tubes to store "yes" and "no" answers, and [[regenerative capacitor memory]].

* The [[Harvard Mark I]] (1944), A big computer that you could kind of program.
* The U.S. Army's [[Ballistics Research Laboratory]] [[ENIAC]] (1946), which could add numbers the way people do (using the numbers 0 through 9) and is sometimes called the first general purpose [[Electronics|electronic]] computer (since [[Konrad Zuse]]'s [[Z3 (computer)|Z3]] of 1941 used [[electromagnets]] instead of [[electronics]]). At first, however, the only way you could reprogram ENIAC was by rewiring it.

Several developers of ENIAC saw its problems. They invented a way to for a computer to remember what they had told it, and a way to change what it remembered. This is known as "stored program architecture" or [[von Neumann architecture]]. [[John von Neumann]] talked about this design in the paper ''[[First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC]]'', distributed in 1945. A number of projects to develop computers based on the stored-program architecture started around this time.  The first of these was completed in [[Great Britain]]. The first to be demonstrated working was the [[Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine]] (SSEM or "Baby"), while the [[EDSAC]], completed a year after SSEM, was the first really useful computer that used the stored program design. Shortly afterwards, the machine originally described by von Neumann's paper—[[EDVAC]]—was completed but was not ready for two years.

Nearly all modern computers use the stored-program architecture in some form. It has become the main [[concept]] which defines a modern computer. Most of the technologies used to build computers have changed since the 1940s, but many current computers still use the von-Neumann architecture.

[[File:80486dx2-large.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Microprocessor]]s are miniaturized devices that often implement stored program [[CPU]]s.]]

In the 1950's computers were built out of mostly [[vacuum tube]]s.  [[Transistors]] replaced vacuum tubes in the 1960's because they were smaller and cheaper.   They also need less power and do not break down as much as vacuum tubes. In the 1970s, technologies were based on [[integrated circuit]]s. [[Microprocessor]]s, such as the [[Intel 4004]] made computers smaller and cheaper. They also made computers faster and more reliable. By the 1980s, computers became small and cheap enough to replace mechanical controls in things like [[washing machine]]s. The 1980s also saw [[home computer]]s and [[personal computer]]. With the evolution of the [[Internet]], personal computers are becoming as common as the [[television]] and the [[telephone]] in the household.

In 2005 Nokia started to call some of its mobile phones (the N-series) "multimedia computers" and after the launch of the Apple [[iPhone]] in 2007, many are now starting to add the [[smartphone]] category among "real" computers. In 2008, if the category of smartphones are included in the numbers of computers in the world, the biggest computer maker by units sold, is no longer Hewlett-Packard, but rather Nokia.{{fact|date=December 2008}}

== Kinds of computers ==
There are six types of computers:  personal computers, mainframes, laptop computers, mini computers, super computers and embedded computers.  

A "desktop computer" is a small machine that has a screen (which is not part of the computer).  Most people keep them on top of a desk, which is why they are called "desktop computers." "[[Laptop]] computers" are computers small enough to fit on your lap.  This makes them easy to carry around. Both laptops and desktops are called personal computers, because one person at a time uses them for things like playing music, surfing the web, or playing video games. 

There are bigger computers that many people at a time can use.  These are called "Mainframes," and these computers do all the things that make things like the internet work. You can think of a personal computer like this:  the personal computer is like your skin:  you can see it, other people can see it, and through your skin you feel wind, water, air, and the rest of the world.  A mainframe is more like your internal organs: you (hopefully) never see them, and you barely even think about them, but if they suddenly went missing, you would have some very big problems.  

There is another type of computer, called an embedded computer.  An embedded computer is a computer that does one thing and one thing only, and usually does it very well.  For example, an alarm clock is a embedded computer:  it tells the time.  Unlike your personal computer, you cannot use your clock to play Tetris.  Because of this, we say that embedded computers cannot be programmed, because you cannot install programs like Tetris on your clock. Some [[mobile phone]]s, [[automatic teller machine]]s, [[microwave oven]]s, [[CD player]]s and [[car]]s are examples of embedded computers.

===All-in-one PC===
All-in-one computers are [[PC|desktop computers]] that have the [[CPU]] and [[computer speaker|speaker]] in the same case as the [[Computer monitor|monitor]]. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] has made several popular examples of all-in-one computers, such as the [[Macintosh 128K|original Macintosh]] of the mid-1980s and the [[iMac]] of the late 1990s and 2000s.

== Common uses of home computers ==
* Playing [[computer game]]s
* [[Writing]]
* Solving [[mathematics]]
* [[search engine | Looking]] for things on the [[Internet]]
* Watching [[TV]] and [[movies]]
* Listening to [[music]]
* [[Communication|Communicating]] with other people
* Downloading
* Sending [[e-mail]]
* Sorting
* Recording
* Calculating
* Editing (Video, Photo)
* Taking Pictures ([[photography]])
* Drawing

== Common uses of work computers ==
* Word processing
* Spreadsheets
* PowerPoint Presentations
* Photo Editing (Photoshop, GIMP)
* E-mail
* Video editing/rendering/encoding
* Audio recording
* System Management

== Working methods ==
Computers store data and the instructions telling them what to do with the data as numbers, because computers can do things with numbers very quickly. These data are stored as [[binary]] [[symbol]]s (1s and 0s). A 1 or a 0 symbol stored by a computer is called a [[bit]], which comes from the words binary [[Numerical digit|digit]]. Computers can use many bits together to represent instructions and the data that these instructions use. A list of instructions is called a [[computer program|program]] and is stored on the computer's [[hard disk]]. Computers work through the program by using a [[central processing unit]], and they use fast memory called [[RAM]] as a space to store the instructions and data while they are doing this. When the computer wants to store the results of the program for later, it uses the [[hard disk]] because things stored on a hard disk can still be remembered after the computer is turned off.

An [[operating system]] tells the computer how to understand what jobs it has to do, how to do these jobs, and how to tell people the results. It tells the electronics inside the computer, or "[[Computer hardware|hardware]]", how to work to get the results it needs. This lets most computers have the same [[operating system]], or list of orders to tell it how to talk to the user, while each computer can have its own computer programs or list of jobs to do what its user needs. Having different programs and [[operating system]]s makes it easy to learn how to use computers for new things. When a user needs to use a computer for something different, the user can learn how to use a new program. Some [[operating system]]s can have simple command lines or a fully user-frendly GUI 

== The Internet ==
One of the most important jobs that computers do for people is helping with [[communication]]. Communication is how people share [[information]]. Computers have helped people move forward in [[science]], [[medicine]], [[business]], and [[learning]], because they let experts from anywhere in the world work with each other and share information. They also let other [[wikt:people|people]] communicate with each other, do their jobs almost anywhere, learn about almost anything, or share their opinions with each other. The [[Internet]] is the thing that lets [[wikt:people|people]] communicate between their computers.

== Computers and waste ==
A computer is now almost always an [[electronic device]].  It usually contains materials that will become [[toxic waste]] when disposed of.  When a new computer is bought in some places, laws require that the cost of its [[waste management]] must also be paid for.  This is called [[product stewardship]].

Computers can become [[wikt:obsolete|obsolete]] quickly, depending on what programs the user runs.  Very often, they are thrown away within two or three years, because newer programs require a more powerful computer. This makes the problem worse, so [[computer recycling]] happens a lot.  Many projects try to send working computers to [[developing nation]]s so they can be re-used and will not become waste as quickly, as most people do not need to run new programs. Some computer parts, such as [[hard drive]]s, can break easily. When these parts end up in the [[landfill]], they can put [[poison]]ous chemicals like [[lead]] into the ground water. Hard drives can also contain secret information like [[credit card]] numbers. If the hard drive is not erased before being thrown away, an [[Identity theft|identity thief]] can get the information off of the hard drive, even if the drive doesn't work, and use it to steal money from the previous owner's bank account.

== Main hardware ==
Computers come in different forms, but most of them have a common design.
* All computers have a [[CPU]].
* All computers have some kind of [[data bus]] which lets them get inputs or output things to the environment.
* All computers have some form of memory. These are usually chips ([[integrated circuit]]s) which can hold information.
* Many computers have some kind of sensors, which lets them get input from their environment.
* Many computers have some kind of display device, which lets them show output. They may also have other [[peripheral equipment|peripheral devices]] connected.
 	
A computer has several main parts. When comparing a computer to a human body, the [[CPU]] is like a brain. It does most of the 'thinking' and tells the rest of the computer how to work. The CPU is on the Motherboard, which is like the skeleton. It provides the basis for where the other parts go, and carries the [[nerves]] that connect them to each other and the CPU. The motherboard is connected to a power supply, which provides [[electricity]] to the entire computer. The various drives ([[compact disc|CD]] drive,  [[floppy drive]], and on many newer computers, [[USB flash drive]]) act like eyes, ears, and fingers, and allow the computer to read different types of storage, in the same way that a human can read different types of books. The [[hard drive]] is like a human's memory, and keeps track of all the data stored on the computer. Most computers have a [[sound card]] or another method of making sound, which is like [[vocal cords]], or a voice box. Connected to the sound card are [[computer speaker|speakers]], which are like a mouth, and are where the sound comes out. Computers might also have a [[graphics card]], which helps the computer to create visual effects, such as 3D environments, or more realistic colors, and more powerful graphics cards can make more realistic or more advanced images, in the same way a well trained artist can.

Modern cosmology is dominated by the [[Big Bang]] theory, which brings together observational astronomy and [[particle physics]].<ref>http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cosmology</ref> 

Though the word ''cosmology'' is recent (first used in 1730 in [[Christian Wolff]]'s ''Cosmologia Generalis''), the study of the universe has a long history.

==History==
Until recently, people thought that the [[universe]] was the [[Milky Way]]. They thought this because they could only see the planets up to [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]] and [[star]]s. With the invention of the [[telescope]], our universe got bigger. Even in the 20th century, people thought that the Milky Way was the universe. With the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], people could see things far away.

An asteroid is a small object in the Solar System that travels around the [[Sun]]. It is like a [[planet]] but smaller. They range from less than 1 km (over 1000 feet) to 600 miles (1000 km) across. A few asteroids have [[asteroid moon]]s.

The name "asteroid" means "like a star" in the ancient [[Greek language]]. Asteroids may look like small stars in the sky, but they really do move around the [[Sun]], while stars only seem to move because the [[Earth]] spins. Like planets, asteroids do not make their own [[light]]. Because of this, some people think "asteroids" is not a good name, and think that the name "planetoid" ("like a planet") would be a better name.

Giuseppe Piazzi found the first asteroid, in 1801. It was named [[1 Ceres]], and is the biggest object in the [[asteroid belt]]. Other asteroids in the asteroid belt, like [[3 Juno|Juno]], [[2 Pallas]], and [[4 Vesta]] were found later. Today, astronomers using computerized [[telescope]]s find thousands of asteroids every month.  

Asteroids are the leftover rock and other material from the formation of the [[Solar System]]. These rocks were too small to make a planet, and could not collide but  some are made of [[carbon]] or [[metal]]. Depending on what's on the surface, they are classified into various kinds in including Type M (metal), Type S (stone), and Type C (carbon).

Most asteroids in our [[Solar System]] are in the [[asteroid belt]] between [[Mars (planet)|Mars]] and [[Jupiter (planet)|Jupiter]]. Many are not in the main asteroid belt. The ones that come close to Earth are called [[Near-Earth asteroid]]s. Many scientists think asteroids striking the Earth killed off [[K/T extinction event|all the dinosaurs]] and caused some of the other [[extinction event]]s.

[[File:Brazil.Brasilia.01.jpg|thumb|[[Brasilia]] Cathedral]]
A church is a [[building]] that was constructed to allow people to meet to [[worship]] together. These people are usually [[Christianity|Christians]], or influenced by Christianity. Some other religious groups also call their religious buildings churches.<ref>Introduction to New and Alternative Religions in America: 2006 - Page 252</ref><ref>An Introduction to the Unitarian and Universalist Traditions - Page 128, 2011</ref>

Depending on the number of people that are in a community, the churches come in different sizes. Small churches are called [[chapel]]s. The churches in a particular geographical area form a group called the [[diocese]].  Each diocese has a [[cathedral]].  In most cases, the cathedral is a very big church. Cathedrals are the seat of [[bishop]]s.

[[File:Madeleine Paris.jpg|thumb|[[La Madeleine, Paris]] is one of the main sights in [[Paris, France]]]]

In the [[Early Christianity|early days of Christianity]] people had to worship in secret. Christian worship was not allowed in the [[Roman empire]], so Christians had to meet in a secret place. Sometimes they met in people’s houses or barns, sometimes they met underground. The first places that were built for Christian worship were small chapels that were cut into a rock where people could worship without being discovered.

After the death of the Roman emperor [[Constantine I (Rome)|Constantine]] in [[337]] A.D. Christians were allowed to have buildings to worship in. These first churches were built on a similar plan to Roman [[basilica]]s. This plan was later used for the fine [[Gothic]] cathedrals and churches that were built at the end of the [[Middle Ages]].

== The parts of a church ==
{{further|List of church architecture terms}}

There are several parts in the architecture of a church. Not all churches will have all these parts:

* The [[nave]] is the main part of the church where the congregation (the people who come to worship) sit. 
* The aisles are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave.
* The transept, if there is one, is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church. This makes the church shaped like a cross, which is a symbol of the belief that [[Jesus]] died on the [[crucifix|cross]].
* The chancel leads up to the [[altar]] at the top of the church. The altar is in the sanctuary. The word “[[sanctuary]]” means “sacred place”. People were not allowed to be [[arrest]]ed in the sanctuary, so they were safe. The altar is usually at the [[east]] end of the church. People in the church sit facing the altar. We say that the church “faces east”.
* Churches will also have a tower or [[steeple]], usually at the west end. If the church has a transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept.

In Roman Catholic churches there is always a stoup (bowl) of [[holy water]] near the entrance of the church. This tradition comes from the fact that Roman [[basilica]]s had a fountain for washing in front of the entrance. The [[font]] is a bowl where people (often babies) are [[baptism|baptized]]. This is also near the entrance of the church. This is a symbol of the fact that it is welcoming the people into the Christian church.

Traditionally the nave has long [[bench]]es for the congregation to sit on. These are called pews. Some churches may now have replaced their pews with chairs so that they can be moved about for different occasions. At the front of the nave is the pulpit where the priest [[preach]]es (these talks are called “[[sermon]]s”). There is also a [[lectern]] (like a large [[music stand]]) from where the lessons (the [[Bible]] readings) are read.

If there are aisles along the side of the nave there will be [[column|pillars]] which hold up the roof. In large churches or cathedrals there may be a row of little arches along the top of these pillars. This is called the triforium. Over the triforium is the clerestory which is a row of small windows high up in the church wall.

The chancel is the most holy part of the church, and this is why it is often separated from the nave by a screen which can be made of wood or stone, or occasionally iron. The congregation can see through the screen. On the top of the screen there may be a cross. This is called a rood (pronounce like “rude”) screen. Priests used to climb up a staircase to the top of the rood screen to read the [[epistle]] and the [[gospel]]. Sometimes people sang from there.

Inside the chancel are the benches where the [[Choir (music)|choir]] sit. These are called choir stalls. They are on both sides. The two sides of the choir sit facing one another. The choir members who sit on the left (north side) are called “cantoris” (the side where the “[[Cantor (church)|cantor]]” sits) and those on the right (south side) are called “decani” (the side where the [[deacon]] sits). In some large churches or cathedrals the seats for the priests tip up. The top of these seats, when they are tipped up, are called misericords (from the Latin word for “mercy”). This is because the priests or monks were able to lean against them when they got tired if they had to stand up for a long time.

Sometimes there are holes in the walls of the screen so that the congregation can see through. These are called squints. If there is a recess in the wall it is called an aumbry. It is a cupboard for [[Eucharist|communion]] [[wine]] that has been blessed by a priest.

The altar may be right at the east end of the church, but in larger churches or cathedrals it is often much farther forward. In that case the very east end is called an apse. Sometimes it is a separate chapel called the “Lady Chapel”.

== Churches through the ages ==

The design of churches changed a lot during the course of history. Often churches were made bigger. When this happened there may be a mixture of architectural styles. These styles vary a lot in different countries.

=== English churches ===

In [[England|English]] churches there were several different periods of architecture:

* The [[Saxon architecture|Saxon]] period ([[7th century|700]]-[[1050]]) was a time when churches were very simple. The end of the church (end of the sanctuary) was often rounded. Hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of [[wood]].
* The [[Norman architecture|Norman]] period ([[1050]]-[[1190]]) came from the style called [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] which was popular in Europe. The arches had ornaments which were called “mouldings”. The tops of the pillars looked like [[cushion]]s, so they were called “cushion capitals”. The windows were narrow and rounded at the top.
* [[Early English architecture|Early English]] or [[Gothic architecture]] ([[1190]]-[[1280]]) was not as solid and heavy as Norman architecture. Towers were elegant and tall, like the tower of [[Salisbury Cathedral]].
* The [[Decorated architecture|Decorated]] style of architecture ([[1280]]-[[1360]])was popular at a time when the [[plague]] (Black Death) was raging and a third of the people in England died. For that reason, not so much building was done then. There were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time.
* The [[Perpendicular architecture|Perpendicular]] style ([[1360]]-[[1540]]) was very grand. It had lots of straight upward lines and [[fan vaulting]]. This can be seen in [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]. Many churches that can be seen in England were built in this period.

In the 1600s, churches were built in a variety of styles. Often they copied some of the older styles. After the [[Great Fire of London]] many new churches were built by the architect Sir [[Christopher Wren]]. They were built in the classical style. Churches continued to be built in later centuries like this, but also the Gothic style continued to be used.

Modern churches often do not have the traditional cross-shape. It is difficult for the congregation to see and hear what is happening in the chancel. Modern churches bring the congregation, choir and priests in closer touch. An example is the round design for the [[Church of Christ the Cornerstone, Milton Keynes|Church of Christ the Cornerstone]] in [[Milton Keynes]]. Modern churches are often simpler but with a warmer character than the Gothic churches. Many have beautiful [[mosaic]] glass windows. [[Coventry Cathedral]] is a famous example of a modern church building.

{{Other uses|constitutions in general|the US Constitution|United States Constitution}}

The constitution of a [[country]] (or a [[state]]) is a special type of [[law]] [[document]] that tells how its [[government]] is supposed to work. It tells how the country's [[leader]]s are to be chosen and how long they get to stay in [[office]], how new laws are made and old laws are to be changed or removed based on law, what kind of people are allowed to [[vote]] and what other [[rights]] they are guaranteed, and how the constitution can be changed.

Limits are put on the Government in how much power they have within the Constitution ''(see [[Rule of Law]] )''. On the other hand, countries with repressive or corrupt governments frequently do not stick to their constitutions, or have bad constitutions without giving freedom to citizens and others. This can be known as [[dictatorship]] or simply "bending the rules". A Constitution is often a way of uniting within a [[Federation]].

The [[United Kingdom|UK's]] constitution is not written in one single [[wikt:document|document]] like many other countries' are. In fact, the UK's constitution is not completely written down at all. Some of it can be found in writing, starting with the [[Magna Carta]] of 1215 and the [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights Act 1689]] and including more modern [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]]. Other parts of it are considered [[common law]] and are made up of the decisions of [[judge]]s over many hundreds of years in a system called legal or [[Judiciary|judicial]] [[Precedent|precedence]]. Because of this, some people say that the [[United Kingdom]] has a ''[[de facto]]'' or "unwritten" constitution.<ref>{{cite book|last=Barnett|first=H.|title=Constitutional and Administrative Law|publisher=Cavendish|location=London|year=2005|edition=5|pages=9|quote=Conversely, "A written constitution is one contained within a single document or a [finite] series of documents, with or without amendments", ''id''.}}</ref>
 
The [[United States]] in 1787 began a trend in the writing of constitutions. The [[United States Constitution]] is also the shortest that people are still using, and it has been changed (amended) many times over the years. It was made after the colonists won their independence from Britain. At first they had the [[Articles of Confederation]] but the Articles were replaced with today's Constitution.

The Indian constitution is the longest ever written constitution in the world. It  has 395 Articles and 12 Schedules in it, divided into 22 parts. It has been amended more than 100 times.

        [[File:At the Devil's Ball 1.jpg|thumb|220px|right|A common image of the devil, red, with [[horn (anatomy)|horns]] and a [[tail]]]]
In some [[religion]]s, the devil is a bad [[spirit]] that tries to create problems for people. Some people also use the words "the Devil" or "[[Satan]]" for the most powerful devil. The word "devil" comes from the Greek word "diabolos" which means "someone who tells lies to hurt you". ("Diabolos" is translated to the English word "[[slander]]er.") The [[New Testament]] uses "diabolos" as a title for [[Satan]], and so "The Devil" became another name for Satan in English.

In the [[Old Testament]], there is the [[serpent]] and the shaitan, who may be two different characters. "Shaitan" in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] means "adversary", an enemy or opponent. Shaitan is also the word used for the devil in the [[Koran]], who often appears as an animal and tries to get people to do the wrong thing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tfd.com/shaitan |title=shaitan |accessdate=27 December 2009 |format= |work=The Free Dictionary }}</ref>

In [[Christianity]] the Devil was originally an [[angel]] in [[heaven]] called Lucifer. But he wanted to be the ruler of heaven and so he revolted against God. After a hard fight he was defeated and thrown out of heaven. Some other angels who helped him were also thrown out.

After the Devil was thrown out of heaven, he started doing bad things on the earth. He wants people to worship him instead of God. Sometimes he tries to trick people by giving them false promises.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gospel-mysteries.net/devil-satan.html |title=The Devil |accessdate=17 February 2010 |format= |work=Gospel Mysteries }}</ref>

The other angels who were thrown out of heaven became evil spirits called demons. They obey the Devil and help him do evil things.

The [[Book of Revelation]] says that God will punish the Devil and his demons by throwing them into a Lake of Fire that burns in [[Hell]]. This will happen in the future.

Artists draw pictures of the Devil that show him as ugly and evil. But nobody knows what he may look like. Usually he is a spirit that nobody can see, but he can make himself look like a real person in order to trick people. Many modern depictions of the devil portray him as a red human-like being with [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]] and a pointed [[tail]], carrying a red [[pitchfork]].

Not all religions believe in the devil. For example, [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] do not believe in the devil.{{fact|date=October 2013}} Many [[Satanism|satanists]] believe in the devil or Satan only as a [[metaphor]], not an actual being or person.

Europe is a [[continent]], the western part of [[Eurasia]]. It is not part of [[Asia]], because of a [[tradition]]al [[east]]ern [[border|boundary]] that includes the [[Ural Mountains]] in [[Russia]] and the [[Bosporus]] in [[Turkey]], and from [[Africa]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to Balkans. The [[Atlantic Ocean]] is to the west of Europe. There are over 50 countries in Europe. [[Andreas M. Kaplan]] describes Europe as "embracing maximum cultural diversity at minimal geographical distances".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2014.03.006|title=Andreas M. Kaplan: European Management and European Business Schools: Insights from the History of Business Schools, European Management Journal, 2014}}</ref> The [[European Union]] is made up of most of the countries in Europe. The city with the most people in Europe is [[Istanbul]].

== Origin of Name ==

Europe is named after a person in [[Greek mythology]] called Europa. She was said to have been abducted to [[Crete]] by Zeus. The name was later used for [[Greece]]. Then as the rest of the area we call Europe started to have cities and empires, the whole area West of the [[Ural Mountains]] became known by the same name.

== Climate ==
In Europe there are different [[climate]]s in different places; for example, in the north like [[Finland]] it stays snowy in the winter for 5–6 months and is about -30 degrees Celsius. However, during winter in [[Spain]] it is warmer and hardly snows, except on high mountains.

== European Union ==

At this time, much of the continent shares some rulership in a body that is above any country, called the [[European Union]].

== History ==

The history of Europe is long and has many turns. Individual specific 'eras' - this is the term meaning long amounts of specific time - can be mentioned:

* Pre-historic (Paleolithic, Mesolithic Neolithic) - 2,600,000 years ago to 5000
* Ancient Greek Civilisation (Minoan, Classical, Hellenistic) - 3000-100 BC
* Roman Civilisation
* Medieval Civilisation (early, high, late) 400 AD-1500 AD
* Early Modern Era (Renaissance, Reformation, Age of Discovery, French Revolution and Napeoleonic Wars) 1500-1800
* Industrialisation 1800-1914
* World War I - 1914-1918
* Interwar Period - 1918-1939
* World War II - 1939-1945
* Cold War - 1945-1989

Distance is how far one thing is from another thing. Distance is a [[measure]] of the space between two things.

== Examples ==
* One ball is 5 [[Foot (unit of length)|feet]] from another ball. The distance between the two balls is 5 feet.
* John walks at a [[speed]] of 6 [[kilometre]]s per [[hour]] for one hour. John [[walk]]s a distance of 6 kilometres. 
* A [[circle]] is a [[curve]]d [[line]]. Each point on the circle is the same distance from the centre of the circle.

== Displacement ==
Distance is different from [[displacement vector|displacement]]. Displacement is the difference between a starting point and a finishing point. It has both a distance and a [[direction]].

== Example of Displacement ==
* Tom walks 6 kilometers [[north]] from his home.  His displacement from home is 6 km north. Next he walks 10 km south. Now he has walked a distance of 16 km, but his displacement from home is 4 km south.

Dimensions are a concept from [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]: One way to define a dimension is to look at the [[degree of freedom|degrees of freedom]] a movement has in in a specific space. There are different concepts where the term dimension is used and there are also different definitons. There is no definition that can satisfy all concepts. 

In a [[vector space]], a dimension is equal to the  [[cardinality]] of the minimal [[Generator (mathematics)|generator]]. It is also equal to the cardinality of the maximal set of [[linear independence|linearly independent]] [[vector]]s of that space. "Normal" objects in everyday life are specified by three dimenensions, which are usually called [[length]], [[width]] and [[depth]]. Mathematicians call this concept [[Euclidean space]].

Dimensions can be used to measure [[position]] too. The [[distance]] to a position from a [[start]]ing place can be measured in the length, width and height [[direction]]s. These distances are a measure of the position.

Sometimes a fourth ([[4D]]) dimension, [[time]], is used to show the [[position]] of an [[event]] in [[time]] and [[Space (physics)|space]].

==Other Dimensions==
In [[modern]] [[science]], people use other dimensions.

Dimensions like [[temperature]] and [[weight]] can be used to show the position of something in less simple [[Space (physics)|spaces]].

[[Mathematician]]s also use dimensions. In mathematics, dimensions are more general. Dimensions in mathematics might not measure things in the [[world]]. The [[rule]]s for doing [[arithmetic]] with dimensions in mathematics might be different than usual arithmetic rules.

==Dimensions and vectors==
[[Vector]]s are used to show distances and directions. Vectors are often used in [[engineering]] and [[science]], and sometimes in  [[mathematics]].

A vector is a list of [[number]]s. There is one number for each dimension. There are arithmetic rules for vectors.

For example, if Jane wants to know the position of Sally, Sally can give Jane a vector to show the position. If Jane and Sally are in the world, there are three dimensions. Therefore, Sally gives Jane a list of three numbers to show her position. The three numbers in the vector Sally gives Jane might be:
# Sally's distance north of Jane
# Sally's distance east of Jane
# Sally's height above Jane

Calculus is a branch of [[mathematics]] which helps us understand changes between values that are related by a [[Function (mathematics)|function]]. For example, if you had one formula telling how much money you got every day, calculus would help you understand related formulas like how much money you have in total, and whether you are getting more money or less than you used to.   All these formulas are  [[function (mathematics)|functions]] of time, and so that is one way to think of calculus -- studying functions of time. There are two different types of calculus. Differential calculus divides things into small (''different'') pieces and tells us how they change from one moment to the next, while integral calculus joins (''integrates'') the small pieces together and tells us how much of something is made, overall, by a series of changes. Calculus is used in many different areas of study such as [[physics]], [[astronomy]], [[biology]], [[engineering]], [[economics]], [[medicine]] and [[sociology]].

==History==
In the 1670s and 1680s, Sir [[Isaac Newton]] in England and [[Gottfried Leibniz]] in Germany figured out calculus at the same time, working separately from each other. Newton wanted to have a new way to predict where to see [[planet]]s in the sky, because [[astronomy]] had always been a popular and useful form of science, and knowing more about the motions of the objects in the night sky was important for [[navigation]] of ships. Leibniz wanted to measure the space (area) under a [[curve]] (a line which is not straight). Many years later, the two men argued over who discovered it first. Scientists from England supported Newton, but scientists from the rest of Europe supported Leibniz. Most [[mathematician]]s today agree that both men share the credit equally. Some parts of modern calculus come from Newton, such as its uses in [[physics]]. Other parts come from Leibniz, such as the symbols used to write it.

They were not the first people to use mathematics to describe the physical world—[[Aristotle]] and [[Pythagoras]] came earlier, and so did [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], who said that mathematics was the language of science. But they were the first to design a system that describes how things change over time and can predict how they will change in the future.

The name "calculus" was the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for a small stone the ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]]s used in counting and [[gambling]]. The English word "calculate" comes from the same Latin word.

==Differential calculus==
{{main|Differential calculus}}   

Differential calculus is the process of finding out the rate of change of a [[variable]] compared to another variable. It can be used to find the speed of a moving object or the slope of a curve, figure out the maximum or minimum points of a curve, or find answers to problems in the [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] areas of physics, among many other uses.

Many amounts can be variables, which can change their value unlike numbers such as 5 or 200. Some examples of variables are [[distance]] and [[time]]. The [[speed]] of an object is how far it travels in a particular time. So if a town is 80 kilometres (50 miles) away and a person in a car gets there in one hour, they have traveled at an average speed of 80 kilometres (50 miles) per hour. But this is only an [[average]]—they may have been traveling faster at some times (on a highway) and slower at others (at a traffic light or on a small street where people live). Imagine a driver trying to figure out a car's speed using only its odometer (distance meter) and clock, without a speedometer!

Until calculus was invented, the only way to work this out was to cut the time into smaller and smaller pieces, so the average speed over the smaller time would get closer and closer to the actual speed at a point in time. This was a very long and hard process and had to be done each time people wanted to work something out.

[[File:Simple curve showing tangents.svg|thumb|right|On a curve, two different points have different slopes. The red and blue lines are [[Trigonometric function|tangent]]s to the curve.]]

A very similar problem is to find the [[wikt:slope|slope]] (how steep it is) at any point on a [[curve]]. The slope of a ''[[straight]]'' line is easy to work out—it is simply how much it goes up (''y'' or [[wikt:vertical|vertical]]) divided by how much it goes across (''x'' or [[wikt:horizontal|horizontal]]). On a ''curve'', though, the slope is a variable (has different values at different points) because the line bends. But if the curve was to be cut into very, very small pieces, the curve at the point would look almost like a very short straight line. So to work out its slope, a straight line can be drawn through the point with the same slope as the curve at that point. If it is done exactly right, the straight line will have the same slope as the curve, and is called a [[Trigonometric function|tangent]]. But there is no way to know (without very complicated mathematics) whether the tangent is exactly right, and our eyes are not accurate enough to be certain whether it is exact or simply very close.

What Newton and Leibniz found was a way to work out the slope (or the speed in the distance example) exactly using simple and logical rules. They divided the curve into an [[infinity|infinite]] number of very small pieces. They then chose points on either side of the range they were interested in and worked out tangents at each. As the points moved closer together towards the point they were interested in, the slope ''approached'' a particular value as the tangents approached the real slope of the curve. They said that this particular value it approached was the actual slope.

[[File:First principles differentiation demo.svg|thumb|220px|A picture that shows what ''x'' and ''x + h'' mean on the curve.]]

Let's say we have a function ''y'' = f(''x''). f is short for [[function (mathematics)|function]], so this equation means "y is a function of x". This tells us that how high y is on the [[vertical]] axis depends on what x (the [[horizontal]] axis) is at that time. For example with the equation ''y'' = ''x''², we know that if ''x'' is 1, then ''y'' will be 1; if ''x'' is 3, then ''y'' will be 9; if ''x'' is 20, then ''y'' will be 400.

<math>\lim_{h\rightarrow0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}</math>

If we use y = x², the derivative produced [[Differential calculus#How_it_works|using this method]] is 2''x'', or 2 multiplied by ''x''. So we know without having to draw any tangent lines that at any point on the curve ''f(x)'' = ''x''², the derivative ''f'(x)'' (marked with an [[apostrophe]]) will be 2''x'' at any point. This process of working out a slope using limits is called differentiation, or finding the derivative.

Leibniz came to the same result, but called h "dx", which means "with respect to x". He called the resulting change in f(x) "dy", which means "a tiny amount of y". Leibniz's notation is used by more books because it is easy to understand when the equations become more complicated. In Leibniz notation:

<math>\frac{dy}{dx} = f'(x)</math>

Mathematicians have grown this basic theory to make simple [[algebra]] rules which can be used to find the derivative of almost any function.

==Main idea of calculus==
The main idea in calculus is called the "Fundamental Theorem of Calculus". This main idea says that the two calculus processes, differential and integral calculus, are opposites. That is, a person can use differential calculus to undo an integral calculus process. Also, a person can use integral calculus to undo a differential calculus method. This is just like using division to "undo" multiplication, or addition to "undo" subtraction.

In a single sentence, the Fundamental Theorem runs something like this: "The derivative of the integral of a function ''f'' is the function itself".

==Demonstration of main idea of calculus==
===How to use integral calculus to find areas===
[[File:Integral as region under curve.svg|right|thumb|280px|Integration can be thought of as a way of finding the area under a curve.]]
[[File:Riemann sum (middlebox).gif|right|thumb|280px|We can approximate the area under a curve by adding up the areas of many rectangles underneath the curve. The more rectangles we use, the better our approximation.]]
The method integral calculus uses to find areas of shapes is to break the shape up into many small boxes, and add up the area of each of the boxes. This gives an approximation to the area.  If the boxes are made narrower and narrower, then there are more and more of them, and the area of all the boxes becomes very close to the area of the shape.  One of the main ideas of calculus is that we can imagine having an infinite number of these boxes, each infinitely narrow, and then we would have the exact area of the shape.

==Other uses of calculus==
Calculus is used to describe things that [[wikt:change|change]], like things in [[nature]]. It can be used for showing and learning all of these:

*How [[wave (physics)|wave]]s move. Waves are very important in the [[natural]] world. For example, [[sound]] and [[light]] can be thought of as waves.
*Where [[heat]] moves, like in a house. This is useful for [[architecture]] (building houses), so that the house can be as cheap to heat as possible.
*How very small things like [[atoms]] act.
*How fast something will [[falling|fall]], also known as [[gravity]].
*How [[machine|machines]] work, also known as [[mechanics]].
*The [[orbit|path]] of the [[moon]] as it moves around the [[earth]]. Also, the path of the earth as it moves around the [[sun]], and any [[planet]] or [[moon]] moving around anything in [[Outer space|space]].

A continent is a large area of the [[land]] on [[Earth]] that is joined together. In general it is agreed there are seven continents: [[Africa]], [[Antarctica]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], [[Australasia]] or [[Oceania]],<ref>Either are accepted terms</ref> and [[South America]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/134805/continent Continent] (2009).

== Alternative versions ==
=== Australia ===
Some sources say that Australia is one of the seven continents.<ref>[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/as.html#Geo World fact book - Australia]</ref> Others say that Australia is part of [[Oceania]].   [[Oceania]] is a region which includes [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and the [[Pacific Islands]].<ref>[http://worldatlas.com/webimage/countrys/au.htm Worldatlas.com - Australia]</ref> The third alternative is the term [[Australasia]], which includes at least all countries on the Australian [[continental plate]]. This includes the islands of [[New Guinea]], [[Tasmania]], New Zealand and a number of smaller islands. It is on the south-eastern side of the [[Wallace Line]], with distinct differences in its biology from the Asian side of the line.

:"It includes all the islands of the Malay Archipelago... as well as the various groups of islands in the Pacific. The term has been used in very different senses".<ref>Wallace, Alfred Russel 1893. ''Australasia'', vol 1. London: Stanford. Chapter 1: Definition.</ref>

=== North and South America ===
North America and South America are often described as "the Americas". This has the advantage of including [[Central America]] and the [[Caribbean]] islands. Otherwise, Central America is counted as part of North America.

=== Eurasia ===
[[Eurasia]] is not really an alternative, it is a recognition that the landmass of Europe and Asia are continuous, and some of its largest countries are in both continents. [[Russia]] extends from eastern Europe to the far east of Asia without a break. The [[Ural Mountains]], which run roughly north/south, are the traditional dividing-line between Europe and Asia. For many purposes it is convenient to consider the great landmass as a single continent, Eurasia.

When [[Britain|British]] people talk about "the Continent" (or "Continental" things) they mean the [[Europe|European mainland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/continent.html |title=Encarta World English Dictionary |accessdate=2008-08-05 |year=2007|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc.|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwRKDyZ6|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}</ref> This meaning is not used as much as it used to be, but is still seen in phrases like "Continental [[breakfast]]" ([[bread|rolls]] with [[cheese]], [[jam]] etc. as distinct from an "English breakfast" which is a cooked breakfast).

Continents not only move but also sometimes move against each other. The Indian subcontinent has been colliding with the Eurasian continent for a while now. As these continents push against each other, they buckle and bend. Because of this, the [[Himalaya Mountains]], where [[Mount Everest]] is, are still being made today.<ref name=holt>{{cite book | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Earth Science| publisher = Holt, Rinehart and Winston| date = 2001| location = United States of America| pages = 211| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-03-055667-8}}</ref>

Fish (plural: fish or fishes) are [[vertebrate]]s which live in water and [[respiration|respire]] (get [[oxygen]]) with [[gills]]. They lack [[limb]]s with digits (fingers & toes). This is a [[definition]] which does not quite work: some [[amphibia]] also live in water and have external gills, but they are not fishes.  

Fish used to be a [[class (biology)|class]] of [[vertebrates]].  Now the term covers five classes of aquatic vertebrates:
:[[Agnatha|Jawless fish]]
:†[[Placodermi|Armoured fish]]
:[[Chondrichthyes|Cartilaginous fish]]
:[[Actinopterygii|Ray-finned fish]]
:[[Sarcopterygii|Lobe-finned fish]]

There are more fish than [[tetrapods]] (land vertebrates): there are over 33,000 described species of fish.<ref>FishBase. [http://www.fishbase.org/search.php]</ref> Fish are usually covered with scales. They have two sets of paired [[fins]] and several unpaired fins. Most fish are cold-blooded ([[poikilotherm]]). A fish takes in the [[oxygen]] from the water using [[gills]]. There are many different kinds of fish. They live in [[fresh water]] in [[lake]]s and [[river]]s, and in [[salt water]] in the [[ocean]]. Some fish are less than one [[centimeter]] long. The largest fish is the [[whale shark]], which can be almost 15 [[metre|meters]] long and weigh 15 [[ton]]s. Most fish live in the water. A group of fish called the [[lungfish]] have developed [[lung]]s because they live in rivers and pools which dry up in certain parts of the year. They burrow into mud and [[aestivation|aestivate]] until the water returns.

'Fish' is a [[paraphyletic]] term in [[cladistics]] because it lacks a [[monophyletic]] group of descendants. It lacks the land vertebrates or [[tetrapod]]s, which descended from fish.

== Fish or fishes? ==
Though often used interchangeably, these words have different meanings. ''Fish'' is used either as singular noun or to describe a group of specimens from a single species. ''Fishes'' describes a group of different species.<ref name=Helfman>Helfman G. ''et al'' 2009.

== Types of fish ==
Fish, the oldest vertebrate group, includes a huge range of types, from the Middle [[Ordovician]], about 490 million years ago, to the present day.

*** [[Coelacanth]]s: two [[species]] survive. They were probably a [[sister-group]] to the [[tetrapod]]s.

Certain animals that have the word ''fish'' in their name are not really fish: [[Crayfish]] are [[crustacean]]s, and [[jellyfish]] are [[Cnidaria]]ns. Some animals look like fish, but are not. [[Whale]]s and [[dolphin]]s are [[mammal]]s, for example.

== Anatomy ==

=== Bony and cartilagenous fish ===
Most kinds of fish have [[bone]]s. Some kinds of fish, such as [[shark]]s and [[ray]]s, do not have real bones (their [[skeleton]]s are made of [[cartilage]]) they are known as [[cartilaginous fish]].

=== Fish scales ===
All fish are covered with overlapping [[Scale (zoology)|scales]], and each major group of fish has its own special type of scale. Teleosts ('modern' fish) have what are called ''leptoid'' scales. These grow in concentric circles and overlap in a head to tail direction like roof tiles. Sharks and other chondrichthyes have ''placoid'' scales made of denticles, like small versions of their teeth. These also overlap in a head to tail direction, producing a tough outer layer. Shark skin is available for purchase as [[shagreen]], a leather which as original is smooth in one direction, and rough in the other direction. It may be polished for use, but is always rough in texture and resistant to slipping.

The scales are usually covered with a layer of [[slime]] which improves passage through the water, and makes the fish more slippery to a [[predator]].

== Swimming ==
Fish swim by exerting force against the surrounding water. There are exceptions, but this is usually done by the fish contracting muscles on either side of its body in order to generate waves of flexion that travel the length of the body from nose to tail, generally getting larger as they go along. Most fishes generate thrust using lateral movements of their body & tail fin (caudal fin). However, there are also species which move mainly using their median and paired fins. The latter group profits from the gained manoeuvrability that is needed when living in coral reefs for example. But they can not swim as fast as fish using their bodies & caudal fins.<ref>Breder C.M. 2003. The locomotion of fishes. ''Zoologica'', 4, 159-256, (1926); ''Journal of Experimental Biology'' 206, 2749-2758 (2003)</ref>

=== Muscle ===
Fish can swim slowly for many hours using red muscle fibres. They also make short, fast bursts using white muscle. The two types of muscle have a fundamentally different [[physiology]]. The red fibres are usually alongside a much greater number of white fibres.

The white fibres get their energy by converting the [[carbohydrate]] [[glycogen]] to lactate ([[lactic acid]]). This is [[anaerobic metabolism]], that is, it does not need [[oxygen]]. They are used for fast, short bursts. Once the lactic acid builds up in the muscles, they stop working, and it takes time for the lactate to be removed, and the glycogen replaced.<ref name=McN>Alexander, R. McNeill. 1974. ''Functional design in fishes''. London: Hutchinson, p31. ISBN 0-09-104751-X</ref> Using their white fibres, fish can reach speeds of 10 lengths per second for short bursts.<ref name=McN/>

Swimming for long periods needs oxygen for the red fibres. The oxygen supply has to be constant because these fibres only operate [[aerobic]]ally. They are red because they have a rich blood supply, and they contain [[myoglobin]]. Myoglobin transports the oxygen to the oxidising systems. Red muscle gets its energy by oxidising [[fat]], which weight for weight has twice as much energy as carbohydrate or protein.<ref name=McN/> Using their red fibres, fish can keep up a speed of 3{{ndash}}5 lengths per second for long periods.<ref name=McN/>

== Body shape ==
The shape of the body of a fish is important to its swimming. This is because [[wikt:streamline|streamlined]] body shapes makes the water drag less. Here are some common fish shapes.

=== Streamlining ===
[[File:White shark.jpg|thumb|230px|right|alt=A smooth, rocket-shaped shark swims quickly through the water.|The rocket-shape of this shark makes it an efficient swimmer. It is fast over short distances.]]

The picture on the right shows a [[shark]]. This shark's shape is called ''fusiform'', and it is an ovoid shape where both ends of the fish are pointy. This is the best shape for going through water quickly.<ref>Nielsen, Knut Schmidt 1984. ''Scaling: why is animal size so important?'' Cambridge. Chapter 15</ref><ref>Baily, Jill 1997. ''How fish swim''. Benchmark, N.Y.</ref> Fishes with fusiform shapes can chase prey and escape predators quickly. Many live in the open ocean and swim constantly, like [[marlin]]s, [[swordfish]], and [[tuna]]. [[Ichthyosaur]]s, [[porpoise]]s, [[dolphin]]s, [[killer whale]]s all have similar shapes. This is an example of [[convergent evolution]].

=== Eel-like ===
The long, ribbon-like shape of an [[eel]]'s body shows another shape.  This enables them to hide in cracks, springing out quickly to capture prey, then returning quickly to their hiding spot.

=== Flatfish ===
[[File:Flounder hawaii.jpg|thumb|230px|alt=a depressed flounder.|An adult flounder has both eyes on the upper side of its body.]]
[[Flatfish]] live on the bottom of the ocean or lake. Most use [[camouflage]]: they change colors to match the ocean floor.

=== Compressed ===
Fish with compressed shapes have flat, vertical bodies, with one eye on each side. They swim upright and can be very thin. They usually live in [[reef]]s where their flat bodies can slip in and out among the [[coral]]s, [[sponge]]s, and rocks, keeping hidden from predators. [[Marine angelfish|Angelfish]], [[surgeonfish]], and [[butterflyfish]] are all compressed fish.

=== Swimming in groups ===
{{main|Shoaling and schooling}}
Many fish swim in groups a lot of the time. Schools of fish can swim together for long distances, and may be chased by predators which also swim in schools. Casual groups are called 'shoals'.

== Fish as food ==
People eat many kinds of fish.  The fish that people eat most include [[carp]], [[cod]], [[herring]], [[perch]], [[sardine]]s, [[sturgeon]], [[tilapia]], [[trout]], [[tuna]], and many others.  A person who buys and sells fish for eating is called a [[fishmonger]].

The word ''to fish'' is also used for the activity of catching fish.  People catch fish with small [[Fishing net|nets]] from the side of the water or from small [[boat]]s, or with big [[Fishing net|nets]] from big boats.  People can also catch fish with [[fishing pole]]s and fishhooks with [[bait]].  This is often called [[angling]].  Anglers also different types of [[fishing lure]]s.

== Fish as pets ==
Some people keep fish as [[pet]]s. [[Goldfish]] and [[Siamese Fighting Fish]] are popular types of pet fish. [[Koi]] and other ornamental fish are often kept by groups of people in public ponds for their beauty and calming nature.

A pet is a [[domestication|domesticated]] [[animal]] that lives with people, but is not forced to [[Labour (economics)|work]] and is not [[eat]]en, in most instances. In most cases, a pet is kept to entertain people or for companionship. Some pets such as dogs and cats are placed in an animal shelter if there is no one willing to take care of it. If no one adopts it or the pet is too old/sick, the pet may be killed.

[[Dog]]s, [[cat]]s, [[fish]], [[bird]]s are the most common pets in [[North America]].  [[Horse]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[ox]]en, and [[donkey]]s are usually made to work, so they are not usually called pets.  Some dogs also do work for people, and it was once common for some birds (like [[falcon]]s and carrier [[pigeon]]s) to work for [[human]]s.

[[Rodents]] are also very popular pets. The most common are [[guinea pig]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[hamsters]] (especially [[Syrian hamster|Syrian]] and [[dwarf hamster]]s), [[mouse|mice]] and [[rat]]s.

The cap'tchi tribe in [[Sudan]] is known for the ritual burning of domesticated animals that are considered too sacred to eat.

        title='Fruit',
        text='''
[[File:Mature flower diagram.svg|thumb|400px|Diagram of flower, cut open, showing the [[ovary (botany)|ovary]]]] 

In [[botany]], a fruit is a plant structure that contains the plant's [[seed]]s. To a botanist, the word ''fruit'' is used only if it comes from the part of the [[flower]] which was an [[ovary (botany)|ovary]].<ref>Mauseth, James D. 2003. ''Botany: an introduction to plant biology''. Jones & Bartlett, Boston.</ref> It is an extra layer round the seeds, which may or may not be fleshy. However, even in botany, there is no general agreement on how fruits should be classified. Many do have extra layers from other parts of the flower.<ref>Schlegel, Rolf 2003. ''Encyclopedic dictionary of plant breeding and related subjects''. Haworth Press. ISBN 1-56022-950-0.</ref>

The fleshy part of a fruit is called the mesocarp. It is between the fruit's skin (exocarp) and the seeds. The white part of an [[apple]], for example, is the "fleshy" part of the apple. Usually, when we eat a fruit, we eat the "fleshy" part.

== Types of fruits ==
[[File:Grapes.jpg|thumb|thumb|left|140px|alt=Grapes hanging on a branch|Grapes are berries]]

===Berry===
If the entire fruit is fleshy, except for maybe a thin skin, we call the fruit a [[berry]]. A berry might contain one seed or many. [[Grape]]s, [[avocado]]s, and [[blueberry|blueberries]] are berries. They all have a thin skin, but most of the fruit is fleshy. [[Strawberry|Strawberries]], however, are actually ''not'' berries, because the seeds are on the outside: on a real berry, the seed or seeds must be inside.

===Pepo===
A pepo (pronounced ''pee' po'') is a [[wikt:modify|modified]] berry. Its skin is hard and thick and is usually called a "rind". [[Pumpkin]]s and [[watermelon]]s, for instance, are pepos.

===Hesperidium===
[[File:Citrus fruits.jpg|thumb|170px|Citrus fruits are hesperidiums]]
A hesperidium is another modified berry. It has a [[leather]]y skin that is not as hard as the skin of a pepo. All [[citrus]] fruit like [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]] and [[lemon]] are hesperidiums.

===Pome===
[[File:PearPhoto.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Pears have a core surrounded by yummy flesh, meaning pears are pomes]]

A pome (pohm) is a fruit that has a [[wikt:core|core]] surrounded by fleshy [[Tissue (biology)|tissue]] that we can eat. The core is usually not eaten. Berries are different - the seeds are ''inside'' the fleshy part, not separated from it by a core. [[Apple]]s and [[pear]]s are pomes.

===Drupe===
[[File:Autumn Red peaches.jpg|thumb|170px|The big hard "pit" in the middle of this peach has a seed inside it]]
Drupes are also called [[stone fruit]]. A drupe is a fleshy fruit with a hard stone around the seed. We usually call this stone the "pit" of the fruit. [[Peach]]es and [[Olive (fruit)|olives]] are drupes. Actually, the [[almond]] fruit is a drupe, too, though we eat the seed that is inside the "pit" of the [[almond]] fruit.

== Botanical fruits ==
Since fruits are produced from fertilised ovaries in [[flower]]s, only [[flowering plant]]s produce fruits. Fruits are an [[evolution]]ary 'invention' which help [[seed]]s get [[wikt:dispersal|dispersed]] by animals.

The botanical term includes many that are not "fruits" in the common sense of the term. such as the vegetables [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[pumpkin]]s, [[cucumber]]s, [[tomato]], [[pea]]s, [[bean]]s, [[corn]], [[eggplant]], and [[sweet pepper]] and some spices, such as [[allspice]] and [[chillie]]s.

=== Accessory fruits ===
[[File:FraiseFruitPhoto.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Strawberry]] fruit: the 'seeds' are each derived from a [[pistil]] of the flower.]]
An accessory fruit or false fruit (pseudocarp) is a fruit in which some of the flesh is derived not from the ovary but from some adjacent tissue.

A fig is a type of accessory fruit called a syconium. [[Pome]]s, such as [[apple]]s and [[pear]]s, are also accessory fruits: the core is the true fruit.<ref>Esau K. 1977. ''Anatomy of seed plants''. Wiley New York.</ref>

== Non-botanical fruits ==
Strictly speaking, these are not botanical fruits: 
* any produced by non-flowering plants, like [[juniper]] berries, which are the seed-containing female cones of conifers.
* fleshy fruit-like growths that develop from other plant tissues (like [[rhubarb]]).

== Area of agreement ==
[[File:vaccinium.jpg|thumb|Berries which are simple fleshy fruit. From top right: [[Cranberry|cranberries]], [[lingonberries]], [[blueberries]] red [[Huckleberry|huckleberries]]]]

These are fruits which you can buy in shops, and which are also acceptable as botanical fruits:
* [[berry fruits]]: [[redcurrant]], [[gooseberry]], [[cranberry]], [[blueberry]] Also, but not commonly known as berry fruits, are [[tomato]], [[avocado]],  [[banana]]
* [[false berries]]: [[blackberry]], [[strawberry]], [[raspberry]]: they are aggregate fruits (see below). The [[yew]] berry is not a fruit at all because the yew is a [[conifer]].<ref>Note: the seed in a yew "berry" is very poisonous.</ref>
* [[stone fruit]]s or drupes: [[plum]], [[cherry]], [[peach]], [[apricot]], [[Olive (fruit)|olive]]
* [[citrus|citrus fruits]], like [[orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[grapefruit]]s, and [[tangerine]]s
* [[aggregate fruit]]s: [[raspberry|raspberries]], [[blackberry|blackberries]]
* [[multiple fruit]]s: [[pineapple]]s, [[fig]]s

Many fruits come from [[tree]]s or [[shrub|bushes]]. For plants, fruits are a means of dispersal, usually by animals. When the fruit breaks apart, the seeds can go into the ground and begin to grow. Most fruits we eat contain a lot of [[water]] and natural [[sugar]]s, and many are high in [[Vitamin C]]. They have a large amount of [[dietary fibre]]. Fruits are usually low in [[protein]] and [[fat]] content, but avocados and some nuts are exceptions to this. Not only humans, but our closest living relatives ([[primates]]) are keen fruit-eaters. So are many other groups of [[herbivorous]] [[mammal]]s and many [[bird]]s.<ref>Lewis, Robert A. 2002. ''CRC dictionary of agricultural sciences''. CRC Press. ISBN 0-8493-2327-4</ref>

== Seedless fruits ==
Seedlessness is an important feature of some fruits of commerce. Commercial bananas, pineapple, and [[watermelon]]s are examples of seedless fruits. Some [[citrus]] fruits, especially oranges, satsumas, mandarin oranges, and [[grapefruit]] are valued for their seedlessness.

Seedless bananas and grapes are [[ploidy|triploids]], and seedlessness results from the abortion of the [[embryo]]nic plant which is produced by fertilisation. The method requires normal pollination and fertilisation.<ref>Spiegel-Roy P. Goldschmidt E.E. 1996. ''The biology of citrus''. Cambridge. ISBN 0-521-33321-0 p87–88</ref>

A farm is a piece of [[land]] used to grow [[crop]]s  and/or [[Animal husbandry|raise animal]]s.

People who grow these plants or raise these animals are called [[farmer]]s. This type of work is called farming. 

Land that is used to grow plants for food, or could be used to grow plants for food is called [[arable]] land. A life raising animals for food is called a [[pastoral]] life. 

Many farms are very large and can cause damage. in some places farms are many and small. 
There are many types of farming. Some people farm to eat the food they produce ([[subsistence agriculture]]). Other farms, including large ones, sell their [[Product (consumer goods)|product]]s to many people far away in [[urban area]]s (industrial farming).  Most subsistence farms are in poorer countries, while industrial farms are in richer countries.

==Names of Farms==

[[File:Heckert GNU white.svg|thumb|right|GNU logo]]
The GNU Free Documentation License (GFDL) is a [[copyleft]] [[license]] for [[open content]]. It was made up by the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) for the [[GNU]] project. It was initially created for use with software documentation, but can be applied to other types of works as well, such as [[Wikipedia]]. 

As a [[copyright]] license, the GFDL is a type of [[contract]] between the creator of a copyrightable work (such as a [[book]], an [[encyclopedia]] article, a [[painting]], or a piece of [[music]]) and anyone else who might want to use it. The GFDL is considered "copyleft" because the license is meant to make it easier to use and re-use the copyrighted work, not to restrict its use. 

If a copyrightable work is released under the GFDL, the creator of the work is saying that anyone else may reproduce, distribute, or modify the work, as long as they follow a set of requirements specified in the GFDL. Among the requirements of the GFDL are that any new work created from the original work is also licensed under the GFDL—that is, once something is licensed as GFDL, it will always stay licensed as GFDL, and anything which uses it also is licensed as GFDL. (Because the license "reproduces" and stays with the work, this is sometimes called a "[[virus|viral]]" license.)

The GFDL also says that in order to distribute or modify a work licensed with the GFDL, the re-user must give credit to any previous authors of the work, and include a list of changes they made to the work. 

Finally, any work licensed with the GFDL must contain, somewhere, the entire text of the license. This provision has been criticized, because it is not always easy to include an entire, long license with a copyrighted work. In a book, for example, it is easy to include one extra page with the license, but if the work is something like a song, or a photograph, it is not easy. 

The GFDL has other requirements that are more complicated. For example, if part of the work is labeled as an "invariant section," it cannot ever be removed or changed by someone using the work ("invariant" means "does not change"). 

Works licensed under the GFDL may be included in with non-GFDL-licensed works only if it is clear which parts of the work are licensed as the GFDL. For example, in a book of poetry it would be easy to label some poems as licensed under the GFDL and some not licensed under it. But it would not be easy to label if part of a song was licensed as GFDL and the rest was not, so this would not be allowed. 

Any use of GFDL material which violates the terms of the GFDL is potentially [[copyright infringement]].

A number of online projects use the GFDL. An online project to license its content under the GFDL is [[Wikipedia]].<ref>[[Wikipedia:Copyrights]]</ref>

The GFDL has been criticized by many people who wish that it made it even easier for content to be re-used. Among the criticisms are that it is very hard to combine GFDL material with other copyleft licenses, that it is not always clear and easy to understand, and that some of its requirements, such as the "invariant sections", are not free at all.

[[File:Brahma Halebid.jpg|thumb|[[Brahma]] is the creator god in [[Hinduism]]. Brahma, [[Shiva]] and [[Vishnu]] are the most important Hindu gods. This image shows Brahma on a [[temple]] wall.]] 

God is the maker of the earth and of everything, according to certain [[religion]]s and [[List of mythologies|mythologies]]. [[Hinduism]] says there is more than one god. [[Theist]]s believe that God created everything that [[wikt:exist|exist]]s.<ref name="Swinburne">{{citation |last=Swinburne |first=R.G. |chapter=God |editor=Honderich, Ted |title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1995 |quote=...most philosophical theologians... have generally regarded him as a personal being, bodiless, omnipresent, creator and sustainer of any universe there may be, perfectly free, omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, and a source of moral obligation; who exists eternally and necessarily...}}.</ref> In most religions, God is believed to be immortal (cannot die), and to have powers to control nature far beyond the powers of humans.

The belief that there is at least one god is usually called [[theism]]. People who reject belief that any deities exist are called [[atheism|atheists]]. [[Agnosticism|Agnostics]] think we cannot know for sure whether any deities exist, but still might (or might not) believe at least one deity exists. People who believe in a god but not in religion are called ''deists''. People who believe that the definition of "''God''" should be defined before taking a theological position are [[Ignosticism|ignostic]].

In some religions there are many [[Deity|gods]]. This is called [[polytheism]]. In other religions, there is only one, which is called [[monotheism]]. In polytheism the word "gods" is usually written in lowercase letters. ''God'' is usually written with an uppercase letter when only one god is believed to exist. Some polytheists also use uppercase when talking about their most important god.

== Does God exist? ==
Many people have asked themselves if God exists. Philosophers, theologians and others have tried to prove that it exists, others have tried to show that it does not exist. In [[Philosophy|philosophical]] terminology, such arguments are about the [[epistemology]] of the [[ontology]] of God. The debate exists mainly in philosophy since science does not address whether or not [[supernatural]] things exist.

There are many philosophical issues with the existence of God. Some definitions of God are not specific.<ref>http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2002/entries/omnipotence/</ref> Arguments for the existence of God typically include [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], [[empiricism|empirical]], [[inductive reasoning|inductive]], and subjective types. Some theories are built around holes in [[evolution|evolutionary theory]], as well as order and complexity in the [[world]]. Arguments against the existence of God typically include empirical, [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and inductive arguments. Conclusions sometimes include: "God does not exist" ([[atheism|strong atheism]]); "God almost certainly does not exist"<ref name="Dawkins">{{cite web 
| last=Dawkins

| accessdate=2007-01-10
| publisher=The Huffington Post}}</ref> (''de facto'' [[atheism]]); "no one knows whether God exists" ([[agnosticism]]); "God exists, but this cannot be proven or disproven" ([[deism]] or [[theism]]); and "God exists and this can be proven" (theism). There are many variations on these positions, and sometimes different names for some of them. For example, the position "God exists and this can be proven" is sometimes called "gnostic theism" or "strong theism".

==Names==
There are different names for God in different religions. Some examples are [[Allah]] in Islam, [[Yahweh]] or [[Elohim]] in Judaism, [[God in the Bahá'í Faith|Baha]] in [[Bahá'í Faith]], [[Waheguru]] in Sikhism, and [[Ahura Mazda]] in Zoroastrianism.

== Believing in God ==
[[File:Europe belief in god.svg|thumb|250px|The percentage of people in European countries who said in 2005 that they "believe there is a God". Countries with [[Eastern Orthodox]] (i.e.: [[Greece]], [[Romania]], etc.) or [[Muslim]] (Turkey) majorities tend to poll highest.]]
In the year  2000, approximately 53% of the world's population were part of one of the three main Abrahamic religions (33% Christian, 20% Islam,  less than 1% Judaism), 6% with Buddhism, 13% with Hinduism, 6% with [[Chinese folk religion|traditional Chinese religion]], 7% with various other religions, and less than 15% as non-religious. Most of these religious beliefs involve God or gods.<ref>National Geographic Family Reference Atlas of the World p. 49</ref>

== God in the Abrahamic religions ==
[[Abrahamic religions]] are very popular monotheistic ones. Well-known Abrahamic religions include [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]].  [[Monotheistic]] means the people in these religions believe there is only one God.  The name of God is usually not allowed to be said in [[Judaism]], but some Jews today call him [[YHWH]] (Yahweh) or Jehovah. [[Muslim]]s say the word [[Allah]], which is the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for "The God." 

Believers in the Abrahamic religions (except Islamic believers) believe that God has created [[human beings]] in his [[image]] or [[wikt:likeness|likeness]], but this idea is rarely taken literally. The idea of an old man with a beard has been used in art since the [[Renaissance]], but is not what most monotheists actually believe he looks like.

=== God in Christianity ===
{{main|God in Christianity}}
The [[Christian]] [[Bible]] talks about God in different ways. Christians say that the [[Old Testament]] talks about "God the Father". The [[New Testament]] is about [[Jesus]], or "God the Son". Many Christians also believe that Jesus was God's [[incarnation]] on earth.  Christians consider the [[Holy Spirit]] to be God as well.

In the [[New Testament]], there are three beings who are said to be God in different forms: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (also known as the Holy Ghost). This is called the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] by most people who believe in it. Although the word "Trinity" is not in the Bible, the word used for God in chapter one of [[Genesis]] is [[plural]], and the words ' in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit' are used in the [[New Testament]], (e.g. [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]] 28:19) Another word that most Christians believe means the same thing as "Trinity" is Godhead. 

Some believe that Jesus was just a man that talked about God.Members of the [[Unitarian Church]] have these beliefs.

Christians believe that [[incarnation|God turned into a man]] named [[Jesus]], and came to Earth to save everyone from [[sin]]. When Jesus prayed and talked to God, he called him "Father," and taught others to do the same.

== God in Eastern religions ==
In [[Hinduism]], there is only one God, named [[Brahman]], but Brahman is said to have taken on many different [[incarnation]]s. Some of these are [[Rama]], [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], [[Shiva]], [[Kali]], [[Parvati]], and [[Durga]]. To many outsiders, the worship of God's different incarnations is considered to be the worship of many gods. However, it is really only the worship of one God in different ways.

Some Hindus also believe that the spirit of God lives in everyone. This idea is called [[Advaita Vedanta]], which is the Hindu term for [[Monism]].

Religions like [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] involve the worship of many gods, or sometimes no gods at all.

== God in Western philosophy ==
Philosophers can talk about God or god; sometimes they talk about a specific god, but other times they are just talking about the idea of god.

One of the earliest Western philosophers to write about God in a monotheistic way was the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[Aristotle]], who describes god as the Supreme Cause. Aristotle saw God as a being that makes everything happen, but is not influenced by anything else.

There are also some philosophical problems with God. One of them is called [[God paradox]]. It is a question about whether (an omnipotent) God can make a mountain that is so heavy he cannot lift it.

Google Inc. is an American [[multinational corporation]] that is best known for running one of the largest [[search engine]]s on the [[World Wide Web]] (WWW). Every day, 200 million (200,000,000) people use it. Google's main office ("Googleplex") is in [[Mountain View, California]], [[United States|USA]].

With [[Google Search]], people can also search for [[picture|pictures]], [[Usenet]] newsgroups, [[news]], and things to [[Online shopping|buy online]]. By June [[2004]], Google had 4.28 billion [[web page]]s on its database, 880 million (880,000,000) pictures and 845 million (845,000,000) Usenet messages — six billion things. 

"To [[wikt:google|google]]," as an action word ([[verb]]) means "to search for something on Google". Because Google is so popular (more than half of people on the web use it) it has been used to mean "to search the web". Google dislikes this use since the name of the company is a [[trademark]].

As a [[public company]], Google Inc. [[Stock trading|trades]] on the [[NASDAQ]] under the tickers [http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/goog GOOG] and [http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/googl GOOGL].

In August 2015, Google announced it was being restructured under a new [[holding company]] called [[Alphabet Inc.]]

== History ==
Google was started in early 1996 by Larry Page and Sergey Brin, two students at [[Stanford University]], USA. It used to be called Backrub. Later, they made it into a company, Google Inc., on [[September 7]], [[1998]] at a friend's garage in [[Menlo Park, California|Menlo Park]], [[California]]. In February [[1999]], the company moved to 165 University Ave., [[Palo Alto, California]].  Later that year, it moved to another place, now called the "Googleplex".

In September 2001, Google's rating system ("PageRank", for saying which information is more helpful) got a U.S. [[Patent]]. The patent was to Stanford University, with Lawrence (Larry) Page as the [[inventor]] (the person who first had the idea).

Google makes an important, though shrinking, percentage of its money through its friends like [[America Online]] and InterActiveCorp. It has a special group known as the Partner Solutions Organization (PSO) which helps make [[contract]]s, helps making accounts better, and gives engineering help.

==How Google makes money==
Google makes money by [[advertising]]. People or companies who want to make other people visit their website give Google money, and Google shows an advertisement to people Google thinks will click on the advertisement. Google only gets money when people click on the link, so it tries to know as much about people as possible to only show the advertisement to the "right people". It does this with Google Analytics, which sends data back to Google whenever someone visits a web site. From this and other data, Google makes a profile about the person, which it then uses to figure out which advertisements to show.

== The name "Google" ==
The name "Google" is a misspelling of the word ''[[googol]]''.<ref>Koller, David. "[http://graphics.stanford.edu/~dk/google_name_origin.html Origin of the name, "Google."] ''[[Stanford University]].'' January, 2004.</ref><ref name=hiw >{{citation|title=Google revolution|publisher=Imagine Publishing|newspaper=How it Works|pages=40-43|issue=37|date=2012-08-09}}</ref> [[Milton Sirotta]], nephew of U.S. mathematician [[Edward Kasner]], made this word in 1938, for the number 1 followed by one hundred zeroes (<math>10^{100}</math>). It is said that the word "googol" was chosen as a name for this number because it sounded like baby talk. Google uses this word because the company wants to make lots of stuff on the Web easy to find and use. Andy Bechtolsheim first thought of the name. 

The name for Google's main office, the "Googleplex," is a play on a different, even bigger number, the "[[googolplex]]", which is 1 followed by one googol of zeroes.

[[File:6n-graf.svg|thumb|300px|right|An undirected graph.]]

Graph theory is a field of [[math]]ematics about graphs. A [[graph]] is an [[abstract]] representation of: A number of [[point (geometry)|point]]s are connected by [[line]]s. Each point is usually called a ''vertex'' (more than one are called ''vertices''), and the lines are called ''edges''.  Graphs are a tool for modelling relationships. They are used to find answers to a number of problems.

Some of these questions are:
* What is the best way for a [[mailman]] to get to all of the [[house]]s in the area in the least amount of [[time]]? The points could represent [[street]] corners and lines could represent the houses along the street. (see [[Chinese postman problem]])

* A salesman has to visit different customers, but wants to keep the distance traveled as small as possible. The problem is to find a way so they can do it. This problem is known as [[Travelling Salesman Problem]] (and often abbreviated ''TSP''). It is among the hardest problems to solve. If a commonly believed [[conjecture]] is true (described as P ≠ NP), then an exact solution requires one to try all possible routes to find which is shortest.

* How many colors would be needed to color a map, if countries sharing a border are colored differently? The points could represent the different areas and the lines could represent that two areas are neighboring. (look at the [[Four color theorem]])

* Can a sketch be drawn in one closed line? The lines of the drawing are the lines of the graph and when two or more lines collide, there is a point in the graph. The task is now to find a way through the graph using each line one time. (look at [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]])

== Different kinds of Graphs ==
[[File:Directed.svg|125px|thumb|A directed graph.]]
*Graph theory has many aspects. Graphs can be directed or undirected. An example of a directed graph would be the system of roads in a city. Some streets in the city are one way streets. This means, that on those parts there is only one direction to follow.
*Graphs can be weighted. An example would be a road network, with distances, or with [[toll]]s (for roads).
*The nodes (the circles in the schematic) of a graph are called [[vertex|vertices]]. The lines connecting the nodes are called [[edge]]s. There can be no line between two nodes, there can be one line, or there can be multiple lines.

[[File:Konigsberg bridges.png|thumb|200px|The Königsberg Bridge problem, on a city map]]
[[File:Königsberg_graph.svg|thumb|200px|The same problem, but using a graph]]

[[Leonhard Euler]] used to live in a city that was called ''Königberg'' for some time. (The city has been called [[Kaliningrad]] since 1946). The city is situated on the river Pregel. There is an island in the river, and there are a number of bridges across the river. Euler loved to go for walks, so he asked himself, whether it was possible to do a walk, use each of the bridges once, and come back to the point where he started. In 1736, he published a scientific article where he showed that this was not possible. Today, this problem is known as the [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]]. The article is seen as the first paper in the history of graph theory.<ref name="Biggs">{{cite book|author=Biggs, N.; Lloyd, E. and Wilson, R.|title=Graph Theory, 1736-1936|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1986}}</ref>  

This article, as well as the one written by [[Alexandre-Théophile Vandermonde|Vandermonde]] on the ''[[Knight's tour|knight problem]],'' carried on with the ''analysis situs'' initiated by [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]]. Euler's formula was about the number of edges, vertices, and faces of a [[convex]] [[polyhedron]] was studied and generalized by [[Augustin Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]]<ref name="Cauchy">{{cite journal|author=Cauchy, A.L.|year=1813|title=Recherche sur les polyèdres - premier mémoire|journal=Journal de l'École Polytechnique|volume= 9 (Cahier 16)|pages=66–86}}</ref> and [[Simon Antoine Jean L'Huillier|L'Huillier]],<ref name="Lhuillier">{{cite journal|author=L'Huillier, S.-A.-J.|title=Mémoire sur la polyèdrométrie|journal=Annales de Mathématiques|volume=3|year=1861|pages=169–189}}</ref> and is at the origin of [[topology]].

Over a century after Euler, [[Arthur Cayley|Cayley]] studied a special class of graphs, called the ''[[tree (graph theory)|trees]]. A tree is a graph where there is only one path between two vertices.  Cayley tried to solve a problem from [[differential calculus]]. His solution influenced the development of theoretical [[chemistry]]. The technique he used mainly focused on listing all graphs which had certain properties. Today, this is called ''Enumerative graph theory''. It developed from Cayleys results, a scientific publication done by  [[George Pólya|Pólya]] between 1935 and 1937 and the generalization of these by [[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|De Bruijn]] in 1959. Cayley linked his results on trees with the contemporary studies of chemical composition.<ref name="Cayley1">{{cite journal|author=Cayley, A.|year=1875|journal=Berichte der deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft|title=Ueber die Analytischen Figuren, welche in der Mathematik Bäume genannt werden und ihre Anwendung auf die Theorie chemischer Verbindungen|volume=8|pages=1056–1059|doi=10.1002/cber.18750080252}}</ref>

The fusion of the ideas coming from mathematics with those coming from chemistry is at the origin of a part of the standard terminology of graph theory. In particular, the term "graph" was introduced by [[James Joseph Sylvester|Sylvester]] in an article published in 1878 in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]''.<ref name="Sylvester">{{cite journal|author=Sylvester, J.J.|year=1878|journal=Nature|title=Chemistry and Algebra|volume=17|pages=284|doi=10.1038/017284a0}}</ref>

One of the most famous and productive problems of graph theory is the [[four color problem]]: "Is it true that any map drawn in the plane may have its regions colored with four colors, in such a way that any two regions having a common border have different colors?" This problem was first posed by [[Francis Guthrie]] in 1852 and its first written record is in a letter of [[Augustus De Morgan|De Morgan]] addressed to [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]] the same year. Many incorrect proofs have been proposed, including those by Cayley, [[Alfred Bray Kempe|Kempe]], and others. The study and the generalization of this problem by [[Peter Guthrie Tait|Tait]], [[Percy John Heawood|Heawood]], [[Frank P. Ramsey|Ramsey]] and [[Hugo Hadwiger|Hadwiger]] led to the study of the colorings of the graphs embedded on surfaces with arbitrary [[Genus (mathematics)|genus]].  Tait's reformulation generated a new class of problems, the ''factorization problems'', particularly studied by [[Julius Petersen|Petersen]] and [[Dénes Kőnig|Kőnig]]. The works of Ramsey on colorations and more specially the results obtained by [[Pál Turán|Turán]] in 1941 was at the origin of another branch of graph theory, ''[[extremal graph theory]]''.

The four color problem remained unsolved for more than a century. A proof produced in 1976 by [[Kenneth Appel]] and [[Wolfgang Haken]],<ref name="AA1">{{cite journal|author=Appel, K. and Haken, W.|title=Every planar map is four colorable. Part I. Discharging|journal=Illinois J. Math.|volume=21|year=1977|pages=429–490}}</ref><ref name="AA2">{{cite journal|author=Appel, K. and Haken, W.|title=Every planar map is four colorable. Part II. Reducibility|journal=Illinois J. Math.|volume=21|year=1977|pages=491–567}}</ref> which involved checking the properties of 1,936 configurations by computer, was not fully accepted at the time due to its complexity. A simpler proof considering only 633 configurations was given twenty years later by [[Neil Robertson (mathematician)|Robertson]], [[Paul Seymour (mathematician)|Seymour]], [[Daniel Sanders (mathematician)|Sanders]] and [[Robin Thomas (mathematician)|Thomas]].<ref name="RSST">{{cite journal|author=Robertson, N.; Sanders, D.; Seymour, P. and Thomas, R.|title=The four color theorem|journal=Journal of Combinatorial Theory Series B|volume=70|year=1997|pages=2–44|doi=10.1006/jctb.1997.1750}}</ref>

The autonomous development of topology from 1860 and 1930 fertilized graph theory back through the works of [[Camille Jordan|Jordan]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski|Kuratowski]] and [[Hassler Whitney|Whitney]]. Another important factor of common development of graph theory and topology came from the use of the techniques of modern algebra. The first example of such a use comes from the work of the physicist [[Gustav Kirchhoff]], who published in 1845 his [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws]] for calculating the [[voltage]] and [[Electric current|current]] in [[electric circuit]]s.

== Graph theory in perspective ==
Graph theory is an important part of mathematics and computer science. To many such problems, exact solutions do exist. Many times however, they are very hard to calculate. Therefore, very often, [[approximation]]s are used. There are two kinds of such approximations, [[Monte-Carlo algorithm]]s and [[Las-Vegas algorithm]]s.

Graphs are normally represented by two different sets, typically set a graph G would be represented as the collection of the sets V and E. The set V is a discrete set containing all vertices of the graph. The set E is a binary set, whose pairwise elements are elements of set V. Each pair in set E represents an edge connecting two vertices.

If every two nodes have an edge between them, then the graph is called the ''complete graph''.

Mathematics, sometimes shortened to maths (in [[England]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[France]]) or math (in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Germany]] and the [[Philippines]]) is the study of [[number]]s, [[shape]]s and [[pattern]]s. [[Mathematician]]s are people who learn about and discover such things in mathematics. Mathematics is useful for solving [[problem]]s that occur in the real world, so many people besides [[mathematician]]s study and use mathematics. Today, mathematics is needed in many jobs. [[Business]], [[science]], [[engineering]], and [[construction]] need some knowledge of mathematics.

Mathematicians [[wikt:solve|solve]] [[problem]]s by using [[logic]]. Mathematicians often use [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]. [[Deduction]] is a special way of [[wikt:think|thinking]] to [[wikt:discover|discover]] and prove new [[wikt:truth|truths]] using old truths. To a mathematician, the reason something is true is just as important as the fact that it is true. Using deduction is what makes mathematical thinking different from other kinds of thinking.

== About ==
''Mathematics'' includes the [[Education|study]] of:
* Numbers (example 3+6=9)
* [[Structure]]: how things are [[organisation|organized]].
* [[wikt:place|Place]]: where things are and their arrangement.
* [[wikt:change|Change]]: how things become different over time.

Mathematics uses [[logic]], paper, and calculator. These things are used to create general [[rule]]s, which are an important part of mathematics. These rules leave out [[information]] that is not important so that a single rule can cover many situations. By finding general rules, mathematics [[solution|solves]] many [[problem]]s at the same time. 

A ''proof'' gives a reason why a rule in mathematics is correct. This is done by using certain other rules that everyone agrees are correct, which are called ''axioms''. A rule that has a proof is sometimes called a ''theorem''. Experts in mathematics perform research to create new theorems. Sometimes experts find an idea that they think is a theorem but can not find a proof for it. That idea is called a ''conjecture'' until they find a proof.

Sometimes, mathematics finds and studies rules or ideas in the real world that we don't understand yet. Often in mathematics, ideas and rules are [[choice|chosen]] because they are considered simple or neat. On the other hand, sometimes these ideas and rules are found in the real world after they are studied in mathematics; this has happened many times in the past. In general, studying the rules and ideas of mathematics can help us [[knowledge|understand]] the world better.

Music is an [[entertainment]] that puts [[sound]]s together in a way that people like or find interesting. Most music includes people [[singing]] with their voices or playing [[musical instrument]]s, such as the [[piano]], [[guitar]], or [[drum]]s.

The word ''music'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''μουσική'' (''mousike''), which means "(art) of the Muses". In [[Ancient Greece]] the [[Muse]]s included the [[god]]desses of music, [[poetry]], [[art]], and [[dance]]. Someone who makes music is called a [[musician]].

== What is music? ==
Music is sound that has been organized by using [[rhythm]], [[melody]] or [[harmony]]. If someone bangs saucepans while [[cooking]], it makes noise. If a person bangs saucepans or pots in a rhythmic way, they are making a simple type of music.

There are four things which music has most of the time:
* Music often has ''[[pitch (music)|pitch]]''. This means high and low [[note (music)|notes]]. [[Tune]]s are made of notes that go up or down or stay on the same pitch.
* Music often has ''[[rhythm]]''. Rhythm is the way the musical sounds and silences are put together in a sequence. Every tune has a rhythm that can be tapped. Music usually has a regular beat.
* Music often has ''[[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]''. This means whether it is quiet or loud or somewhere in between.
* Music often has ''[[timbre]]''. This is a French word (pronounced the French way: "TAM-br"). The "timbre" of a sound is the way that a sound is interesting. The sort of sound might be harsh, gentle, dry, warm, or something else. Timbre is what makes a [[clarinet]] sound different from an [[oboe]], and what makes one person's [[voice]] sound different from another person.

=== Definitions ===
There is no simple definition of music which covers all cases. It is an art form, and [[opinion]]s come into play. Music is whatever people think is music. A different approach is to list the qualities music must have, such as, sound which has rhythm, melody, pitch, timbre, etc.

These and other attempts, do not capture all aspects of music, or leave out examples which definitely are music. According to Thomas Clifton, music is "a certain reciprocal relation established between a person, his [[behavior]], and a sounding object".<ref name=Clifton>Clifton, Thomas. 1983. Music as heard: a study in applied phenomenology. New Haven and London: Yale University Press. ISBN 0-300-02091-0</ref><sup>p10</sup> Musical experience and the music, together, are called [[phenomenon|phenomena]], and the activity of describing phenomena is called [[phenomenology]].

== History ==
[[File:Maler der Grabkammer des Nacht 004.jpg|thumb|230px|Musicians of [[Amun]], Tomb of  Nakht, 18th Dynasty, Western [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]]]

Even in the [[stone age]] people made music. The first music was probably made trying to imitate sounds and rhythms that occurred naturally. Human music may echo these [[phenomenon|phenomena]] using [[pattern]]s, [[repetition]] and [[tonality]]. This kind of music is still here today. [[Shamanism|Shamans]] sometimes imitate sounds that are heard in [[nature]].<ref name=onom>[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf  Hoppál 2006: 143]</ref><ref name=soy>Diószegi 1960: 203</ref> It may also serve as [[entertainment]] (games),<ref name=Nattiez>Nattiez, Jean-Jacques. 1990. ''Music and discourse: toward a semiology of music''. Translated by Carolyn Abbate. Princeton: Princeton University Press. ISBN 0-691-09136-6</ref><ref name=desch>[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]</ref> or have practical uses, like [[lure|luring]] animals when [[hunting]].<ref name=Nattiez/>

Some animals also can use music. [[Songbird]]s use [[song]] to [[wikt:simple:protect|protect]] their [[territory]], or to attract a [[mate]]. [[Monkey]]s have been seen beating hollow logs. This may, of course, also serve to defend the territory.

The first musical instrument used by humans was probably the [[voice]]. The human voice can make many different kinds of sounds. The [[larynx]] (voice box) is like a [[wind instruments|wind instrument]].

The oldest known [[Neanderthal]] [[hyoid]] bone with the modern human form was found in 1983,<ref>{{cite journal | author = B. Arensburg A.M.  Tillier B. Vandermeersch H. Duday L.A. Schepartz & Y. Rak | year = 1989 | month = April | title = A Middle Palaeolithic human hyoid bone | journal = Nature | issue =  338 | pages = 758–760 | doi = 10.1038/338758a0 | volume = 338}}</ref> indicating that the Neanderthals had language, because the hyoid supports the voice box in the human throat.<ref>McClarnon A.M. & Hewitt G.P. 1999.

Most likely the first [[rhythm]] instruments or [[percussion instruments]] involved the [[clapping]] of hands, stones hit together, or other things that are useful to keep a beat. There are finds of this type that date back to the [[paleolithic]]. Some of these are ambiguous, as they can be used either as a [[tool]] or a musical instrument.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf|title="The Evolutionary Origins and Archaeology of Music|author=Ian Morley|year=2003|format=pdf}}</ref>

The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered near [[Greystones]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], in 2004. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50&nbsp;cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.<ref>http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s1105308.htm</ref>

In 1986 several bone flutes were found in [[Jiahu]] in Henan Province, China. They date to about 6,000 BC. They have between 5 and 8 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird, the [[Red-crowned Crane]]. At the time of the discovery, one was found to be still playable. The bone flute plays both the five- or seven-note scale of [[Xia Zhi]] and six-note scale of [[Qing Shang]] of the ancient [[Chinese musical system]].

=== Ancient times ===
It is not known what the earliest music of the [[cave]] people was like. Some [[architecture]], even some [[painting]]s, are thousands of years old, but old music could not survive until people learned to write it down. The only way we can guess about early music is by looking at very old paintings that show people playing musical instruments, or by finding them in [[archaeology|archaeological]] digs (digging under the ground to find old things). The earliest piece of music that was ever written down and that has not been lost was discovered on a tablet written in [[Hurrians|Hurrian]], a [[language]] spoken in and around northern [[Mesopotamia]] (where Iraq is today), from about 1500 BC.

=== Middle Ages ===
Another early piece of written music that has survived was a [[round (music)|round]] called ''[[Sumer Is Icumen In]]''. It was written down by a [[monk]] around the year 1250. Much of the music in the [[Middle Ages]] (roughly 450-1420) was [[folk music]] played by working people who wanted to sing or dance. When people played instruments, they were usually playing for dancers. However, most of the music that was written down was for the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic church]]. This music was written for monks to sing in church. It is called Chant (or [[Gregorian chant]]).

=== Renaissance ===
In the [[Renaissance]] (roughly 1400-1550) there was a lot of music, and many composers wrote music that has survived so that it can be performed, played or sung today. The name for this period (Renaissance) is a French word which means "rebirth". This period was called the "rebirth" because many new types of [[art]] and music were [[birth|reborn]] during this time.

Some very beautiful music was written for use in church services (sacred music) by the Italian composer [[Giovanni da Palestrina]] (1525-1594). In Palestrina's music, many singers sing together (this is called a [[Choir (music)|choir]]). There was also plenty of music not written for the church, such as happy [[dance music]] and romantic love songs. Popular instruments during the Renaissance included the [[viol]]s (a [[string instrument]] played with a [[bow (music)|bow)]], [[lute]]s (a plucked stringed instrument that is a little like a [[guitar]]), and the [[virginal]], a small, quiet [[keyboard instrument]].

=== Baroque ===
In the arts, the Baroque was a Western cultural era, which began near the turn of the 17th century in Rome. It was exemplified by drama and grandeur in sculpture, painting, literature, dance, and music.<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul|last=Fargis|title=The New York Public Library Desk Reference|year=1998|edition=third|place=New York|publisher=Macmillan General Reference|page=262|isbn=0-02-862169-7}}</ref> In music, the term 'Baroque' applies to the final period of dominance of imitative counterpoint, where different voices and instruments echo each other but at different pitches, sometimes inverting the echo, and even reversing thematic material.

The popularity and success of the Baroque style was encouraged by the Roman Catholic Church which had decided at the time of the Council of Trent that the arts should communicate religious themes in direct and emotional involvement. The upper class also saw the dramatic style of Baroque architecture and art as a means of impressing visitors and expressing triumphant power and control. Baroque palaces are built around an entrance of courts, grand staircases and reception rooms of sequentially increasing opulence. In similar profusions of detail, art, music, architecture, and literature inspired each other in the Baroque cultural movement as artists explored what they could create from repeated and varied patterns. Some traits and aspects of Baroque paintings that differentiate this style from others are the abundant amount of details, often bright polychromy, less realistic faces of subjects, and an overall sense of awe, which was one of the goals in Baroque art.

The word baroque probably derives from the ancient Portuguese noun "barroco"<ref>''OED'' Online. Accessed 6 June 2008.</ref> which is a pearl that is not round but of unpredictable and elaborate shape. Hence, in informal usage, the word baroque can simply mean that something is "elaborate", with many details, without reference to the Baroque styles of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

=== Classical period ===
In western music, the [[Classical music period|classical period]] means music from about 1750 to 1825. It was the time of composers like [[Joseph Haydn]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], and [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]. Orchestras became bigger, and composers often wrote longer pieces of music called [[symphony|symphonies]] that had several sections (called [[movement (music)|movements]]). Some movements of a symphony were loud and fast; other movements were quiet and sad. The form of a piece of music was very important at this time. Music had to have a nice 'shape'. They often used a structure which was called [[sonata form]].

Another important type of music was the [[string quartet]], which is a piece of music written for two [[violin]]s, a [[viola]], and a [[violoncello]]. Like symphonies, string quartet music had several sections. Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven each wrote many famous string quartets.

The piano was invented during this time. Composers liked the piano, because it could be used to play dynamics (getting louder or getting softer). Other popular instruments included the [[violin]], the [[violoncello]], the [[flute]], the [[clarinet]], and the [[oboe]].

=== Romantic period ===
The 19th century is called the [[Romantic music|Romantic period]]. Composers were particularly interested in conveying their emotions through music. An important instrument from the Romantic period was the [[piano]]. Some composers, such as [[Frederic Chopin]] wrote subdued, expressive, quietly emotional piano pieces. Often music described a feeling or told a story using sounds. Other composers, such as [[Franz Schubert]] wrote songs for a singer and a piano player called [[Lied]] (the German word for "song"). These Lieder (plural of Lied) told stories by using the [[lyrics]] (words) of the song and by the imaginative piano [[accompaniment (music)|accompaniments]]. Other composers, like Richard Strauss, and [[Franz Liszt]] created narratives and told stories using only music, which is called a tone poem. Composers, such as [[Franz Liszt]] and [[Johannes Brahms]] used the piano to play loud, dramatic, strongly emotional music.

Many composers began writing music for bigger orchestras, with as many as 100 instruments. It was the period of "[[Nationalism]]" (the feeling of being proud of one's country) when many composers made music using [[folk music|folksong]] or melodies from their country. Lots of famous composers lived at this time such as [[Franz Schubert]], [[Felix Mendelssohn]], [[Frederic Chopin]], [[Johannes Brahms]], [[Pyotr Tchaikovsky]] and [[Richard Wagner]].

=== Modern times ===
From about 1900 onwards is called the "modern period". Many [[20th century]] composers wanted to compose music that sounded different from the Classical and Romantic music. Modern composers searched for new ideas, such as using new instruments, different forms, different sounds, or different [[harmony|harmonies]].

The composer [[Arnold Schoenberg]] (1874-1951) wrote pieces which were [[atonal]] (meaning that they did not sound as if they were in any clear musical key). Later, Schoenberg invented a new system for writing music called [[twelve-tone system]]. Music written with the twelve-tone system sounds strange to some, but is mathematical in nature, often making sense only after careful study. Pure twelve-tone music was popular among academics in the fifties and sixties, but some composers such as [[Benjamin Britten]] use it today, when it is necessary to get a certain feel.

One of the most important 20th-century composers, [[Igor Stravinsky]] (1882-1971), wrote music with very complicated (difficult) [[chord]]s (groups of notes that are played together) and [[rhythm]]s. Some composers thought music was getting too complicated and so they wrote [[Minimalism|Minimalist]] pieces which use very simple ideas. In the 1950s and 1960s, composers such as [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]] experimented with [[electronic music]], using electronic circuits, [[amplifier]]s and [[loudspeaker]]s. In the 1970s, composers began using electronic synthesizers and musical instruments from [[rock and roll]] music, such as the [[electric guitar]]. They used these new instruments to make new sounds.

Composers writing in the 1990s and the 2000s, such as [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams]] (born 1947) and [[James MacMillan]] (born 1959) often use a mixture of all these ideas, but they like to write [[tonality|tonal]] music with easy tunes as well.

These days many new artists have come up such as Bruno Mars, Adam Levine, Taylor Swift, Charli XCX and many more constantly changing the face of the modern day music with songs like Gorilla, Maps, Break the Rules, Blank Space and many more.

==== Electronic music ====
Music can be produced electronically. This is most commonly done by computers, keyboards, electric guitars and disk tables. They can mimic traditional instruments, and also produce very different sounds. 21st-century electronic music is commonly made with computer programs and hardware mixers.

==== Jazz ====
[[Jazz]] is a type of music that was invented around 1900 in [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] in the south of the [[United States|USA]]. There were many black musicians living there who played a style of music called [[blues]] music. Blues music was influenced by [[Africa]]n music (because the black people in the United States had come to the United States as [[slave]]s. They were taken from Africa by force). Blues music was a music that was played by singing, using the harmonica, or the acoustic guitar. Many blues songs had sad lyrics about sad emotions (feelings) or sad experiences, such as losing a job, a family member dying, or having to go to [[jail]] (prison).

Jazz music mixed together blues music with [[Europe]]an music. Some black composers such as [[Scott Joplin]] were writing music called [[ragtime]], which had a very different rhythm from standard European music, but used notes that were similar to some European music. Ragtime was a big influence on early jazz, called Dixieland jazz. Jazz musicians used instruments such as the [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], and [[clarinet]] were used for the tunes (melodies), drums for [[percussion]] and plucked [[double bass]], [[piano]], [[banjo]] and [[guitar]] for the background rhythm (rhythmic section). Jazz is usually [[improvisation|improvised]]: the players make up (invent) the music as they play. Even though jazz musicians are making up the music, jazz music still has [[rule]]s; the musicians play a series of chords (groups of notes) in order.

Jazz music has a swinging rhythm. The word "swing" is hard to explain. For a rhythm to be a "swinging rhythm" it has to feel natural and relaxed. Swing rhythm is not even like a march. There is a long-short feel instead of a same-same feel. A "swinging rhythm" also gets the people who are listening excited, because they like the sound of it. Some people say that a "swinging rhythm" happens when all the jazz musicians start to feel the same pulse and energy from the song. If a jazz band plays very well together, people will say "that is a swinging jazz band" or "that band really swings well."

Jazz influenced other types of music like the [[classical music|Western art music]] from the 1920s and 1930s. Art music composers such as [[George Gershwin]] wrote music that was influenced by jazz. Jazz music influenced [[pop music]] songs. In the 1930s and 1940s, many pop music songs began using chords or melodies from jazz songs. One of the best known jazz musicians was [[Louis Armstrong]] (1900-1971).

==== Pop music ====
{{main |Pop music}}
"Pop" music is a type of ''popular'' music that many people like to listen to. The term "pop music" can be used for all kinds of music that was written to be popular. The word "pop music" was used from about 1880 onwards, when a type of music called music was popular.

Modern pop music grew out of 1950s [[rock and roll]], (for example [[Chuck Berry]], [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Little Richard]])<ref>{{Gilliland |show=5 |title=Hail, Hail, Rock 'n' Roll}} Shows 5, 3, 6.</ref> and [[rockabilly]] (for example [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Buddy Holly]]).{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 7, 12}}   In the 1960s, [[The Beatles]] became a famous pop music group.{{sfn |Gilliland |1969 |loc=shows 27-28, 35, 39}} In the 1970s, other styles of music were mixed with pop music, such as [[funk]] and [[soul music]]. Pop music generally has a heavy (strong) beat, so that it is good for dancing. Pop singers normally sing with microphones that are plugged into an [[amplifier]] and a [[loudspeaker]].

== Musical notation ==
{{Main|Musical notation}}
[[File:Mozart k545 opening.png|thumb|right|360px|''[[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] : ''First movement of the piano sonata K545'' - an example of writing music in [[staff (music)|staff]]s]]"Musical notation" is the way music is written down. Music needs to be written down in order to be saved and remembered for future performances. In this way composers (people who write music) can tell others how to play the musical piece as it was meant to be played.

=== Solfège ===
Solfège (also called solfa) is the way tones are named. It was made in order to give a name to the several tones and pitches. For example, the eight basic notes "Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do" are just the names of the eight notes that confirm the [[major scale]].

=== Written music ===
Music can be written in several ways. When it is written on a [[staff (music)|staff]] (like in the example shown), the pitches (tones) and their duration are represented by symbols called [[Note (music)|notes]]. Notes are to put on the lines and in the spaces between the lines. Each position says which tone must be played. The higher the note is in the staff, the higher the pitch of the tone. The lower the notes are, the lower the pitch. The duration of the notes (how long they are played for) is shown by making the note "heads" black or white, and by giving them stems and flags.

Music can also be written with letters, naming them as in the solfa "Do, Re, Mi, Fa, So, La, Ti, Do" or representing them by letters. The next table shows how each note of the solfa is represented in the [[Standard Notation]]:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Solfa Name !! Standard Notation
|-
| Do || C
|-
| Re || D
|-
| Mi || E
|-
| Fa || F
|-
| Sol || G
|-
| La || A
|-
| Ti || B
|}
The Standard Notation was made to simplify the lecture of music notes, although it is mostly used to represent [[Chord (Music)|chords]] and the names of the [[Scale (Music)|music scales]].

These ways to represent music ease the way a person reads music. There are more ways to write and represent music, but they are less known and may be more complicated.

== How to enjoy music ==
=== By listening ===
People can enjoy music by listening to it. They can go to [[concert]]s to hear musicians perform. [[Classical music]] is usually performed in [[concert hall]]s, but sometimes huge festivals are organized in which it is performed outside, in a field or stadium, like pop festivals. People can listen to music on [[compact disc|CDs]], [[PC|Computers]], [[iPod]]s, [[television]], the [[radio]], [[cassette/record-player]]s and even [[Cell phone|mobile phones]].

There is so much music today, in [[elevator]]s, shopping [[mall]]s, and [[Shop|stores]], that it often becomes a background sound that we do not really hear. Sometimes it is good to listen more closely to music: by trying to hear the different instruments and what types of notes the instruments are playing.

=== By playing or singing ===
People can learn to play an instrument. Probably the most common for complete beginners is the [[piano]] or [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]], the [[guitar]], or the [[recorder]] (which is certainly the cheapest to buy). After they have learnt to play [[scale (music)|scales]], play simple [[tune]]s and read the simplest [[musical notation]], then they can think about which instrument for further development. They should choose an instrument that is practical for their size. For example, a very short child cannot play a full size [[double bass]], because the double bass is over five feet high. People should choose an instrument that they enjoy playing, because playing regularly is the only way to get better. Finally, it helps to have a good [[teacher]].

=== By composing ===
Anyone can make up his or her own pieces of music. It is not difficult to compose simple songs or melodies (tunes). It's easier for people who can play an instrument themselves. All it takes is experimenting with the sounds that an instrument makes. Someone can make up a piece that tells a story, or just find a nice tune and think about ways it can be changed each time it is repeated. The instrument might be someone's own voice.

The Islamic World consists of all people who are in [[Islam]]. It is not an exact location, but rather a [[community]]. When they do things together as Muslims, they are the "[[umma]]", which means "community" referring to all of the believers. The faith emphasizes unity and defense of fellow Muslims, so it is common for these nations to cooperate. [[Recent conflicts in the Muslim World]] have sometimes spread because of this desire to cooperate (see below). It is also likely that some have been made shorter and less damaging because of it. Some might even have never started.

== Demographics ==
Muslims are in many countries. In 52 nations, Muslims are the majority. Almost all are [[Sunni]]. They speak about 60 languages and come from all ethnic backgrounds. 

* 10.4 million Muslims in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]
* 2.2 million Muslims in [[Latin America|Latin]] and [[Central America]]
* 10.0 million Muslims in the [[European Union]] plus [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and [[Albania]]
* few or none in [[Eastern Europe]], [[Norway]]
* 62.4 million Muslims in [[Turkey]]
* 284.4 million Muslims in the [[Arab League]] including [[Iraq]] (with about 15 million [[Shia]], 60% of the population)
* 254.0 Muslims in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]
* 65.4 million Muslims (90% [[Shia]]) in [[Iran]]
* 48.5 million Muslims in [[Central Asia]] - in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Uzebekistan]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]] - formerly [[republics of the Soviet Union]].
* 26.7 million Muslims in [[Russia]]
* 22.7 million Muslims in [[Afghanistan]]
* 230.0 million Muslims in [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] (formerly [[East Bengal]] provincial region).
* 133.3 million Muslims in [[Republic of India]] (included [[Jammu and Kashmir]]) - the world's largest minority population
* 133.1 million Muslims in [[China]] - a close second
34.6 million Muslims in Somalia
* 196.3 million Muslims in [[Indonesia]]
* 30.0 million Muslims in the rest of [[South-East Asia]], especially [[Malaysia]]
* few or none in Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Mongolia, or the South Pacific

* 1.5 billion people total

== Media ==
The ''[[Al-Jazeera]]'' satellite TV network in the [[Arabic language]] is a news source many Muslims watch.

In most Muslim nations, the government is the main source of news. This sometimes makes it very difficult or dangerous to make anti-government statements.

There are, however, many other news programmes and websites in the Muslim world.

== Islam in law and ethics ==
[[Islamic law]] exists in many variations - in Arabic it is called [[shariah]] - five schools of which were created centuries ago. These are the [[classical fiqh]]: the [[Hanafi]] school from [[India]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangaladesh]], [[West Africa]], [[Egypt]], the [[Maliki]] in [[North Africa]] and [[West Africa]], the [[Shafi]] in [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]], the [[Hanbali]] in [[Arabia]], and [[Jaferi]] in [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]] - where the majority is [[Shia]]. All five are very old and many Muslims feel a new fiqh must be created for modern [[society]]. Islam has a method for doing this, [[al-urf]] and [[ijtihad]] are the words to describe this method, but they have not been used in a long time, and few people are trusted enough to use them to make new laws.

So, in most of the Muslim world, people are very conservative, especially about [[alcohol]], [[adultery]], [[abortion]] and [[women]] working in jobs where they are used to lure customers.

[[Muslim women]] often dress extremely modestly, and many do so by choice. But in some countries they have been forced to do so against their will. This is one of the things that causes tension between the [[Western World]] and that of Muslims.

[[Islamic economics]] bans [[debt]] but in most Muslim countries Western [[banking]] is allowed. This is another issue that many Muslims have with the Western world.

== Islam in politics ==
One quarter of the [[world]] population share Islam as an [[ethical tradition]]. 

Many people in these countries also see [[Islam as a political movement]]. In democratic countries there is usually at least one [[Islamic party]].

[[Political Islam]] is powerful in all Muslim-majority countries. [[Islamic parties]] in [[Pakistan]] and [[Algeria]] have taken power. 

Many in these movements call themselves [[Islamist]]s, which also sometimes describes more [[militant Islam]]ic groups. The relationships between these groups and their views of democracy are complex.

Some of these groups are called [[terrorist]]s because they attack civilians of other non-Muslim nations, to make a political point.

== Conflicts with Israel and the US ==
[[Israel]] is very unpopular in the Muslim world, because of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] and the way that the state of Israel came into being in [[1948]] which many [[Arab]]s thought was unfair.

Some Muslims see this as a fight against [[Judaism]] or [[Jew]]s, but not all. In [[Morocco]] for instance, the Islamists recently invited [[Jew]]s to join the party. Jewish groups also cooperate with Arabs in the [[West Bank]], where [[Neturei Karta]] (anti-Zionist orthodox Jewish) leader Rabbi [[Mosche Hirsch]] served as the Minister for Jewish Affairs in the [[Fatah]] before there was a [[Palestinian Authority]]. Like the Arabs, this small group of Jews thought the way Israel was created was not right. However, very few Jews believe this, and most support Israel as a state.

In [[1979]] there was a big shift in the way the Muslim world dealt with the rest of the world. In that year, [[Egypt]] made peace with [[Israel]], [[Iran]] became an [[Islamic state]] after a [[revolution]], and there was an [[1979 invasion of Afghanistan|invasion of Afghanistan]] by the [[Soviet Union]]. A lot of things changed in that year. By [[2001]] the [[Soviet Union]] was gone, [[Jordan]] had also made peace with Israel, and on [[September 11, 2001]] there were major attacks on the U.S. - which most people believe were made to drive the United States out of the Muslim world, especially [[Saudi Arabia]]. In many ways the events of 1979 led to the events of 2001.

The [[2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] are called part of a [[War on Terrorism]] by the [[United States]]. Many or most Muslims see it as a [[War on Islam]]. After the invasion, the [[Islamic parties]] won more seats, and a majority of Muslims polled in many nations expressed support for [[Osama bin Laden]] and said he would "do the right thing". [[Olivier Roy]] is a French scholar who thinks that this does not express support for [[al-Qaeda]] or [[militant Islam]] but opposing [[colonialism]] and what many Muslims call [[racism]] - favourable treatment for Jews especially those living in [[West Bank settlement]]s, many of whom have American or British passport, and which the [[United Nations]] says have no right to live there.

The situation is very complicated and there are many different views of it.

== Organization ==
The [[Organization of Islamic Conference]] formed in [[1969]] lets the Muslim nations work as a group. [[Russia]] joined in [[2003]].

The [[Arab League]] is a smaller group of only the Arab countries.

[[OPEC]] is another forum where issues between the Muslim and non-Muslim world come up. In [[1973]] to protest U.S. support for Israel there was an [[1973 oil embargo|oil embargo]] which caused the [[1973 energy crisis]].

The Milky Way has a [[diameter]] of 100,000 [[light year]]s,<ref name="seds" /> and is a [[barred spiral galaxy]]. The discovery of the Milky Way goes back to the [[Ancient Greek]] [[philosopher]] [[Democritus]].<ref name="space" />  The Milky Way has three main parts:  a ''disk'', in which the Solar System resides, a ''bulge'' at the core, and an all encompassing ''halo''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/gr/public/gal_milky.html|title=Our own Galaxy - the Milky Way|publisher=University of Cambridge|date=1996|accessdate=2012-11-12}}</ref>

This galaxy belongs to the [[Local Group]] of three large galaxies and over 50 smaller galaxies. The Milky Way is one of the largest galaxies in the group, second to the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].<ref name="seds" /> Milky Way's closest [[neighbour]] is [[Canis Major Dwarf]], which is about 25,000 light years away from the [[Earth]]. The Andromeda Galaxy moves towards the Milky Way Galaxy, and will meet it in about 3.75 billion years.<ref>NASA 2012. NASA's Hubble shows Milky Way is destined for head-on collision.

The stellar disc of the Milky Way does not have a sharp edge, a radius beyond which there are no stars. Rather, the number of stars drops smoothly with distance from the centre of the Galaxy. Beyond a radius of about 40,000 light years, the number of stars drops much faster, for reasons that are not understood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3857 |title=[0909.3857&#93; The structure of the outer galactic disc as revealed by IPHAS early A stars |publisher=Arxiv.org |date=2009|accessdate=2010-08-10}}</ref>

Extending beyond the stellar disk is a much thicker disk of gas. Recent observations indicate that the gaseous disk of the Milky Way has a thickness of around 12000 light years–twice the previously accepted value.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.smh.com.au/milky-way-fatter-than-first-thought/20080220-1tbv.html |title=Milky Way fatter than first thought |accessdate=2008-04-24 |date=2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |publisher=Australian Associated Press }}</ref> As a guide to the relative physical scale of the Milky Way, if the Solar System out to the orbit of [[Pluto]] were reduced to the size of a [[quarter (U.S. coin)|US quarter]] (about an inch or 25 mm in diameter), the Milky Way would have a diameter of 2,000 kilometers.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.cfa.harvard.edu/seuforum/howfar/across.html | work= NASA-Smithsonian Education Forum on the Structure and Evolution of the Universe, at the Harvard Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics  | accessdate=March 13, 2013 | title=How Big is Our Universe: How far is it across the Milky Way?}}</ref> At 220 kilometers per second it takes the [[Solar System]] about 240 million years to complete one orbit of the Galaxy (a galactic year).<ref>Sparke, Linda S. & Gallagher, John S. 2007.

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Zeus]] places his son (the baby [[Heracles]]) whose mother was a [[wikt:mortal|mortal]] [[woman]] on [[Hera]]'s [[breast]] while she is sleeping so that the baby will drink her divine milk and become [[immortality|immortal]]. However, Hera wakes up while she is breastfeeding the baby and realizes she is nursing a baby she does not know. According to Greek mythology, she then pushes the baby away and a stream of her milk sprays the night sky, making a [[wikt:faint|faint]] band of light known as the Milky Way.<ref name=cox1/><ref>{{Cite web

Compared to what is known about the other planets in the [[Solar System]], little is known about Mercury. [[Telescope]]s on the Earth show only a small, bright crescent. The first of two [[spacecraft]] to visit the planet was [[Mariner 10|Mariner&nbsp;10]],<ref>[http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1973-085A]</ref> which mapped only about 45% of the planet’s surface from 1974 to 1975. The second is the [[MESSENGER]] spacecraft, which finished mapping the planet in March 2013. 

Mercury looks a lot like Earth's [[Moon]]. It has many [[crater]]s with areas of smooth plains, no moons around it and no [[atmosphere]] as we know it. However, Mercury does have an extremely thin atmosphere, known as an exosphere.<ref name=sciencefact /> Unlike Earth's moon, Mercury has a large [[iron]] [[planetary core|core]], which gives off a [[magnetic field]] about 1% as strong as that of the [[Earth]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-spc.igpp.ucla.edu/personnel/russell/papers/merc_mag/|title=Mercury magnetic field|publisher=C.

Known sightings of Mercury date back to at least the first millennium BC. Before the 4th century BC, Greek [[astronomers]] thought that Mercury was two different objects: one able to be seen only at sunrise, which they called [[Apollo]]; the other that was only able to be seen at sunset, which they called [[Hermes]].<ref name="Dunne">{{cite book|title=The Voyage of Mariner&nbsp;10 — Mission to Venus and Mercury|author=Dunne, J.

Even though Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun, it is not the warmest. This is because it has no atmosphere, so any heat that the Sun gives to it quickly escapes into space.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/14143062 | title=CBBC Newsround | publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation | accessdate=February 04, 2012}}</ref>

A communication network is a group of things that are connected together using some form of talking or other [[communication]] to transfer information or data. The pattern by which things are connected is called a [[network topology]]. A [[television network]], for example, connects [[television station]]s. [[Computer network]]s are numerous.

Physics, a branch of [[science]], is the study of all forces and their impacts on the environment. Modern physics connects ideas together about the four laws of symmetry and conservation (energy, momentum, charge, and parity). The word  ''physics'' comes from the [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] word ἡ φύσις "nature".

== Definition ==

Physics is the study of [[energy]] and [[matter]] in [[Space (physics)|space]] and [[time]] and how they are related to each other. Physicists assume the existence of [[mass]], [[length]], [[time]] and [[electric current]] and then define (give the meaning of) all other [[physical quantity|physical quantities]] in terms of these [[units of measurement|basic units]]. Mass, length, time, and electric current are never defined but the [[standard]] units used to measure them are always defined. In the [[International System of Units]] (abbreviated SI from the French Système International), the [[kilogram]] is the basic unit of mass, the [[metre]] is the basic unit of length, the [[second]] is the basic unit of time, the [[Ampere]] is the basic unit of electric current.

In addition to these four units, there are three other ones: the [[Mole (unit)|mole]], which is the unit of the quantity of matter, the [[candela]] which measures the luminous intensity (the power of lighting) and the [[Kelvin]], the unit of temperature.

Physics studies how things move, and the [[Force (physics)|forces]] that make them move. For example, [[velocity]] and [[acceleration]] are used by physics to show how things move. Also, [[physicists]] study the [[Force (physics)|forces]] of [[gravity]], [[electricity]], [[magnetism]] and the forces that hold things together. 

Physics studies very large things, and very small things. For instance, physicists can study [[star]]s, [[planet]]s and [[galaxy|galaxies]] but could also study small pieces of matter, such as [[atom]]s and [[electron]]s.They may also study [[sound]], [[light]] and other [[wave]]s. As well as that, they could examine [[energy]], [[heat]] and [[radioactivity]], and even [[Space (physics)|space]] and [[time]]. 
Physics not only helps people understand how objects move, but how they change form, how they make [[noise]], how [[heat|hot]] or [[cold]] they will be, and what they are made of at the [[atom|smallest level]].

== Physics and Mathematics==

Physics is a [[quantity|quantitative]] science because it is based on [[measure|measuring]] with [[number]]s. [[Maths]] is used in physics to make [[model]]s that try to [[prediction|guess]] what will happen in [[nature]]. The guesses are compared to the way the [[real]] [[world]] works. [[Physicist]]s are always working to make their models of the world better.

== Advanced knowledge ==
=== General description ===
Physics is the [[science]] of [[matter]] and how [[matter]] interacts. [[Matter]] is any physical material in the [[universe]]. Everything is made of [[matter]]. Physics is used to describe the physical universe around us, and to predict how it will behave. 
Physics is the [[science]] concerned with the discovery and characterization of the universal laws which govern [[matter]], [[movement]] and [[Force (physics)|forces]], and [[Space (physics)|space]] and [[time]], and other features of the natural world.

=== Breadth and goals of physics ===
The sweep of physics is broad, from the smallest components of matter and the forces that hold it together, to [[galaxy|galaxies]] and even larger things. There are only four [[force]]s that appear to operate over this whole range. However, even these four [[force]]s ([[gravity]], [[electromagnetism]], the [[weak force]] associated with radioactivity, and the [[strong force]] which holds [[protons]] and [[neutrons]] in an [[atom]] together) are believed to be different parts of a single force. 

Physics is mainly focused on the goal of making ever simpler, more general, and more accurate rules that define the character and behavior of matter and space itself. 
One of the major goals of physics is making theories that apply to everything in the universe. In other words, physics can be viewed as the study of those universal laws which define, at the most basic level possible, the behavior of the physical [[universe]].

=== Physics uses the scientific method ===
Physics uses the [[scientific method]]. That is, data from experiments and observations are [[:wikt:collect|collected]]. Theories which attempt to explain these data are produced. Physics uses these theories to not only describe physical phenomena, but to model physical systems and predict how these physical systems will behave. Physicists then compare these predictions to observations or experimental evidence to show whether the theory is right or wrong.

The theories that are well supported by data and are especially simple and general are sometimes called [[scientific law]]s. Of course, all theories, including those known as laws, can be replaced by more accurate and more general laws, when a disagreement with data is found.<ref>An equation (e.g., f = m a) is called a "law" when there are clear empirical results that substantiate it.</ref>

=== Physics is quantitative ===
Physics is more quantitative than most other sciences. That is, many of the observations in physics may be represented in the form of numerical measurements. Most of the theories in physics use mathematics to express their principles. Most of the predictions from these theories are numerical. This is because of the areas which physics has addressed are more amenable to quantitative approaches than other areas. Sciences also tend to become more quantitative with time as they become more highly developed, and physics is one of the oldest sciences.

=== Fields of physics ===

[[Classical physics]] normally includes the fields of [[mechanics]], [[optics]], [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[acoustics]] and [[thermodynamics]]. Modern physics is a term normally used to cover fields which rely on quantum theory, including [[quantum mechanics]], atomic physics, [[nuclear physics]], [[particle physics]] and [[condensed matter physics]], as well as the more modern fields of [[general relativity|general]] and [[special relativity]]. Although this distinction can be found in older writings, it is of little recent interest as quantum effects are now understood to be of importance even in fields previously considered classical.<ref>Different people, however, have different definitions of what they regard physics to be, and another common definition is that, "''physics is the science of [[nature]]''" [1,2,3,4,5,6].</ref>

=== Approaches in physics ===
There are many approaches to studying physics, and many different kinds of activities in physics. There are two main types of activities in physics; the collection of data and the development of theories. 

The data in some subfields of physics is amenable to experiment. For example, condensed matter physics and nuclear physics benefit from the ability to perform experiments. Experimental physics focuses mainly on an [[Empiricism|empirical]] approach. Sometimes experiments are done to explore nature, and in other cases experiments are performed to produce data to compare with the predictions of theories. 

Some other fields in physics like astrophysics and geophysics are primarily observational sciences because most their data has to be collected passively instead of through experimentation. Nevertheless, observational programs in these fields uses many of the same tools and technology that are used in the experimental subfields of physics. 
 
Theoretical physics often uses quantitative approaches to develop the theories that attempt to explain the data. In this way, theoretical physics often relies heavily on tools from [[mathematics]]. Theoretical physics often can involve creating quantitative predictions of physical theories, and comparing these predictions quantitatively with data. Theoretical physics sometimes creates models of physical systems before data is available to test and validate these models. There are many significant uses of physics like measuring houses or any measure. Also, it can be used to measure falling objects like planes. 

These two main activities in physics, data collection and theory production and testing, draw on many different skills. This has led to a lot of specialization in physics, and the introduction, development and use of tools from other fields. For example, theoretical physicists apply mathematics and numerical analysis and statistics and probability and computer software in their work. Experimental physicists develop instruments and techniques for collecting data, drawing on engineering and computer technology and many other fields of technology. Often the tools from these other areas are not quite appropriate for the needs of physics, and need to be adapted or more advanced versions have to be produced.

== Physicists ==
There are many famous physicists. [[Isaac Newton]] studied gravity. [[Galileo Galilei]] studied [[light]] and how planets moved. [[Albert Einstein]] made a [[theory]] for how light can make [[electron]]s move, and studied how gravity affects light and space. [[James Clerk Maxwell]] proved that light is a type of [[electromagnetic wave]].

{{otheruse|Pi}}

Pi or <math>\pi</math> is a [[mathematical constant]], one of the first ever discovered. It is the [[ratio]] of the distance around a [[circle]] to the circle's [[diameter]]. This produces a number, and that number is always the same. However, the number is rather strange. The number starts 3.14159265... and continues without end. Such numbers are called [[Irrational number|irrational]].

The diameter is the longest line which can be fitted inside a circle. It passes through the center of the circle. The distance around a circle is known as the [[circumference]]. Even though the diameter and circumference are different for different circles, the number pi remains constant: its value never changes. This is because the relationship between the circumference and diameter is always the same.<ref>Lennart Berggren, Jonathan M. Borwein, and Peter B. Borwein (eds.), ''Pi: A Source Book''. 2nd ed, Springer, 1999. ISBN 978-0-387-98946-4</ref>

== Approximation ==
[[File:Pi-unrolled-720.gif|thumb|right|A diagram showing how <math>\pi</math> can be found by using a [[circle]] with a [[diameter]] of [[one]]. The [[circumference]] of this circle is <math>/pi</math>.]]
Pi is often written formally as <math>\pi</math> or the Greek letter π as a shortcut.  Pi is also an [[irrational number]], meaning it cannot be written as a [[Fraction (mathematics)|fraction]] (<math>a \over b</math>), where 'a' and 'b' are [[integer]]s (whole numbers). This basically means that the digits of pi that are to the right of the [[decimal]] go [[Infinity|forever]] without repeating in a pattern, and that it is impossible to write the exact value of pi as a number. Pi can only be [[approximated]], or measured to a value that is close enough for practical purposes.<ref name="About Pi">{{cite web |url=http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.pi.html |title=About Pi |accessdate=2010-06-05 |author=[http://goodwin.drexel.edu/ Goodwin College of Professional Studies]. |date=1994-2010 |format=html}}</ref>

A value close to pi is 3.141592653589793238462... A common fraction approximation of pi is <math>22 \over 7</math>, which yields approximately 3.14285714. This approximation is 0.04% away from the true value of pi. While this approximation is accepted for most of its use in real life, the fraction <math>355 \over 113</math> is more accurate (giving about 3.14159292), and can be used when a value closer to pi is needed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://zenwerx.com/pi.php |title=Pi to 4 Million Decimals |accessdate=2010-06-05 |format=php}}</ref> [[Computer]]s can be used to get better approximations of pi.

== History ==
Value of Pi was known to Ancient Indian mathematicians like Bhaskaracharya,  and Aryabhatt.
[[Mathematician]]s have known about pi for thousands of years because they have been working with circles for the same amount of time. [[Civilizations]] as old as the [[Babylonia]]ns have been able to approximate pi to many digits, such as the fraction 25/8 and 256/81. Most historians believe that [[ancient Egypt]]ians had no concept of π and that the correspondence is a coincidence.<ref name=unleashed>Arndt, Jörg & Haenel, Christoph 2006. ''Pi unleashed''. Springer-Verlag, 168. ISBN 978-3-540-66572-4</ref>

The first written reference to it dates to 1900 BC.<ref>Beckmann, Petr 1971. ''A History of Pi''. St. Martins Press, London.</ref> Around 1650 BC the Egyptian Ahmes gave a value in the ''Rhind Papyrus''. The Babylonians were able to find that the value of pi was slightly [[greater than]] 3 by simply making a big circle and then sticking a piece of rope onto the circumference and the diameter, taking note of their distances, and then dividing the circumference by the diameter.

Knowledge of the number pi passed back into [[Europe]] and into the hands of the [[Hebrews]], who made the number important in a section of the [[Bible]] called the [[Old Testament]]. After this, the most common way of trying to find pi was to [[wikt:inscribe|draw]] a shape of many sides inside any circle and use the [[area]] of the [[polygon|shape]] to find measure pi. The Greek philosopher [[Archimedes]], for example, used a [[polygon]] shape that had 96 sides in order to find the value of pi, but the Chinese in 500 A.D. were able to use a polygon with 16,384 sides to find the value of pi. The Greeks, like [[Anaxagoras]] of Clazomenae, were also busy with finding out other properties of the circle, such as how to make squares of circles and squaring the number pi. Since then, many people have been trying to find out more and more exact values of pi.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/HistTopics/Pi_through_the_ages.html |title=Pi History |accessdate=2010-06-05 |coauthors=J.J.

In the 16th century, better and better ways of finding pi became available such as the complicated [[formula]] that the French lawyer François Viète developed. The first use of the Greek symbol "π" was in an essay written in 1706 by William Jones.

A [[mathematician]] named Lambert also [[proved|showed]] in 1761 that the number pi was [[irrational number|irrational]]; that is, it cannot be written as a fraction by normal standards. Another mathematician named Lindeman was also able to show in 1882 that pi was part of the group of numbers known as [[transcendentals]], which are numbers that cannot be the solution to a [[polynomial]] equation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.math.com/tables/constants/pi.htm |title=PI |accessdate=2010-06-06 |date=2000-2005 |format=htm}}</ref>

Pi can also be used for figuring out many other things beside circles.<ref name=unleashed/> The properties of pi have allowed it to be used in many other areas of math besides [[geometry]], which studies shapes. Some of these areas are [[complex analysis]], [[trigonometry]], and [[Series (mathematics)|series]].

== Pi in real life ==
Today, there are different ways to calculate many digits of <math>\pi</math>. This is of limited use though.

Pi can sometimes be used to work out the area or the circumference of any circle. To find the circumference of a circle, use the formula C (circumference) = π times [[diameter]]. To find the area of a circle, use the formula π ([[radius]]²). This formula is sometimes written as <math>A = \pi r^2</math>, where ''r'' is the [[variable]] for the radius of any circle and ''A'' is the variable for the area of that circle.

To calculate the circumference of a circle with an error of 1&nbsp;mm:
* 4 digits are needed for a radius of 30 meters
* 10 digits for a radius equal to that of the earth
* 15 digits for a radius equal to the distance from the earth to the sun.

People generally celebrate March 14 as [[Pi Day]] because March 14 is also written as 3/14, which represents the first three numbers 3.14 in the [[approximation]] of pi.<ref name="About Pi"/>

Planets are ball-shaped ([[sphere]]s). Objects that orbit planets are called [[Satellite (natural)|moons]]. Planets orbiting a star are called a star system. There are eight planets in our [[Solar System]]. [[Pluto]] used to be known as a planet, but in August 2006, the [[International Astronomical Union]] decided it was a [[dwarf planet]] instead. There are four more known dwarf planets in the Solar System, [[1 Ceres|Ceres]], [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]], [[136199 Eris|Eris]] and [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]].

The name "planet" is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word πλανήτης (''planetes''), meaning "wanderers", or "things that move". Until the 1990s, people only knew of those in the Solar System. As of June 2011, we know of 563 other planets.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jean Schneider|title=Interactive Extra-solar Planets Catalog|url=http://exoplanet.eu/catalog.php|work=The Extrasolar Planets Encyclopedia|accessdate=2011-06-23}}</ref> All of these newly found planets are orbiting other stars: they are [[Extrasolar planet|''extrasolar'' planets]]. Sometimes people call them "exoplanets".</onlyinclude>

The planets in the Solar System have names of [[Greek mythology|Greek]] or [[Roman mythology|Roman]] gods, apart from Earth, because people did not think Earth was a planet in old times. However, Earth is occasionally referred by the name of a Roman god: ''Terra''. Other languages, for example [[Chinese language|Chinese]], use different names. Moons also have names of gods and people from classical [[myth]]ology, or from the [[theatre|plays]] written by [[Shakespeare]].

=== Types of planets ===
Astronomers speak about ''major'' (or true) planets, and [[minor planet]]s, which are smaller objects that go around the Sun. Some examples of "minor planets" are [[asteroid]]s, [[comet]]s, and [[trans-Neptunian object]]s.

Planets in the Solar System are of three sorts:
* [[Terrestrial planet|''Terrestrial'' or ''rocky'']]: Planets that are similar to Earth — in them is mostly [[Rock (geology)|rock]]: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars. 
* [[Gas giant|''Jovian'' or ''gas giant'']]: These planets are mostly made of [[gas]]: Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune. Uranian planets are a special sort of gas giants, they have more [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]].
* [[Ice dwarf|''Icy'']]: Sometimes people also have a third sort, for bodies such as [[Pluto]] (though Pluto is no longer called a planet by everyone). These planets are mostly made of [[ice]].
Many objects in the Solar System that are not planets are also "icy". Examples are the icy moons of the outer planets of the Solar System (like [[Triton (moon)|Triton]]).

{{Religion}}
A religion is a set of [[belief]]s that is held by a group of people. There are many different religions, each with a different set of beliefs. The beliefs are about the world and the people in it, about how they came into being, and what their purpose is. These beliefs are often linked to [[supernatural]] beings such as [[God]], a number of [[Deity|gods]] or [[spirit]]s. They may also be linked to an idea such as a path that the spirit of each person should take towards goodness, truth and duty. This is called [[spirituality]]. Each religion has different ideas about these things. Each religion also has a "[[moral]] code" which is a set of beliefs about how humans should act. Each religion usually has their own type of "devotions" when people worship or pray. They often have [[ritual]]s (special things that are always done in the same way) for certain times of the year or certain times of a person's life.<ref>[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/religion Reference Dictionary- Religion]</ref> Other words that are used for religion are "faith" and "belief system".<ref>The words "belief system" may not necessarily refer to a religion, though a religion may be referred to as "belief system."</ref> Altogether, followers of religion can be known as ''religionists''. Some people follow more than one religion at a time.

The largest religions are [[Christianity]], [[Islam]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Judaism]]. There are many [[List of religions|other religions]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html|title=Major Religions by adherents}}</ref> People who do not believe in any gods are called [[atheism|atheists]]. People who say that they are not sure whether they believe or not are called [[agnosticism|agnostics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html#Nonreligious|title=Secular, Nonreligious, Agnostic, Atheist}}</ref><ref name="AtheismAgnosticismSEP">{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/atheism-agnosticism/|title=Atheism and Agnosticism|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

== Religious beliefs ==
=== God ===
[[File:Brahma Musée Guimet 25971.jpg|thumb|upright|A statue of the Hindu deity [[Brahma]].]]

In many religions, one of the main beliefs is that there is a "deity" (or [[Deity|god]]) who is a great [[Creation myth|creator]] spirit. In many religions, there is just [[Monotheism|one deity]] that the people believe in. In other religions, there are [[Polytheism|many deities]] who each have different roles in the [[universe]]. In many religions, there are other types of spirits. These may include [[angel]]s, [[devil]]s and other such things which can be both good and bad.

Giving honour to God, the gods or the spirits is an important part of most religions. While this may often be done privately, it is also often done with gatherings of people and [[ritual]]s. These rituals are often based on old [[tradition]]s, and may have been done in almost the same way for hundreds, or even thousands of years.

[[File:Mother Teresa.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mother Teresa of Calcutta was known for her Christian kindness.]]

=== Human spirit ===
Another main belief is that humans have a "soul" or spirit which lives on after their body has died. The person's spirit is on a journey through life that continues after death. Most religions believe that what a person does during their lifetime will affect what happens to their spirit in the [[afterlife]]. Many religions teach that a good person's spirit can reach a special place of peace and happiness such as [[Heaven]] or [[Nirvana]], and that a bad person's spirit can travel to a place of pain and suffering such as [[Hell]]. Still other religions believe in [[reincarnation]] - that instead of going either to Heaven or Hell, spirits of the dead return to earth in a new body.

=== Morality ===
"Morals" are the way a human behaves to other humans. Most religions make rules about human morals. The rules of how people should act to each other are different in different religions.

For some religions, following a "path" of goodness, truth and duty is very important. This is called [[Tao]] in China. In the teachings of [[Judaism]], people were told to "love your neighbour as yourself". In the teachings of [[Jesus]], people were told to think of every single person as their "neighbour" and treat them with love.

Not every religion teaches people to be kind to all other people. In many religions, it has been common for people to believe that they have to act kindly only to some people and not to others. In some religions, people believed that they could please a god by killing or [[human sacrifice|sacrificing]] another person.

== Traditions ==
[[File:Shane Claiborne OCP.jpg|thumb|The man on the left is teaching others about his religion]]
=== Teaching ===
A religion is passed on from one person to another through teachings and stories (which are often called "myths") which may be written down like the [[Bible]], or [[Oral tradition|told from memory]] like the [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreamtime]] stories of [[Indigenous Australians|Australian Aboriginal]] people. In many religions, there are people who take the role of "priest" and spend their lives teaching others about the religion. There are also people who take the role of "pastor" and spend their life caring for other people. A person may be both a priest and a pastor. They are called by different names in different religions.

=== Symbols ===
[[Symbol]]s are used to remind people of their religious beliefs. They are also used or worn as a sign to other people that the person belongs to a particular religion. A symbol might be something that is drawn or written, it might be a piece of clothing or jewellery, it might be a sign that a person makes with their body, or it might be a building or monument or artwork. Picture symbols for different religions are shown in the box in the introduction to this article.

=== Witness and conversion ===
In many religions, it is thought important that people should show other people that they are following a particular religion. This might be done in a general way by wearing a symbol or a type of clothing. Many people believe that it is important to tell other people about their religion, so that they can believe as well. This is called "witnessing". 
[[File:Sikhs on the move!.jpg|thumb|left|These Sikhs in Canada wear a head-dress of turban or head scarf as a symbol and witness to their religion.]]
There are many ways to witness. A young person might simply say to their friends "I do not use drugs or get drunk because of my religion". This is a witness. A person may tell their classmates, workmates and friends about their beliefs. A person might go to other people's houses and talk about their beliefs, or invite the people to join in the rituals of the religion, such as going to church or to a religious festival. A person might have printed material such as books or leaflets that they give to other people to read. A person might travel to a different country to teach, to work in a health service or to help people in some other way. (People who do this are called "missionaries".) These are different ways that people witness to their religion.

When a person hears a witness and decides that they will join the religion, this is called a "conversion". Usually a person decides to join a religion because they like what they have read or been told, and they believe that they are hearing the truth. They join the religion because they choose. However, throughout history there have been many times when people have been forced to join a religion by violence and threats. This is still happening today.

In most countries of the world, people are free to belong to whatever religion they choose. This is generally thought of as a basic [[Human rights|human right]]. However, there are parts of the world where it is illegal (against the law) to witness to any religion except the one accepted by the government of the country. People who belong to other religions may be threatened, put in jail or murdered.

[[File:Muslim man at prayer.jpg|thumb|upright|A Muslim man at prayer. Prayer is an important ritual for many religious people.]]

=== Ritual ===
[[Ritual]]s are an important part of the tradition of many religions. In many religions, it is the tradition for people to meet for a celebration on one day in every week. There are also major celebrations that may be held only at certain times of the year, for example, on the birthday of a person who is honoured in that religion. Some religions have celebrations for different seasons of the year, or when the sun or moon is in a certain part of the sky.

In nearly every religion, the important stages of a person's life have a religious celebration. Birth, naming, reaching an age to think for oneself, reaching adulthood, marriage, childbirth, sickness and death are all celebrated by some religions. Having a celebration or special traditions when a person dies is very common.

It is the traditions that are about death that give the earliest evidence of religious beliefs. Scientists have discovered that 120,000 years ago, [[Neanderthal]] people started burying their dead. Early [[Homo sapiens]] put tools and other things into graves with the bodies, as if they could use them in the afterlife. From 40,000 years ago, many of the objects in graves are small artworks. Scientists believe that these objects were put there for religious reasons.

[[File:Dalai Lama and Bishop Tutu. Carey Linde.jpg|thumb|left|Leaders in two religious institutions, the Dalai Lama (Buddhist) and Archbishop Desmond Tutu ([[Anglican Church|Anglican]])]]

=== Groups and institutions ===
An [[institution]] is one name for an organization. Many religions have organizations that manage the way that people who follow the religion are to act. The organization might [[employment|employ]] religious leaders, [[education|educate]] people into the ideas of the religion, manage money, own buildings and make rules. Many religions have sub-groups which are called [[denomination]]s. In Islam, for example, there is [[Ahmadiyya]], [[Sunnism]], [[Shi'ism]] and [[Sufism]].

=== Buildings ===
[[File:Psalms WesternWall.jpg|thumb|A Jewish man reads the Psalms of David at the Western Wall, [[Jerusalem]].]]
Most religions have special buildings where people meet. They are often called [[temple]]s. In [[Judaism]], they are called [[synagogue]]s. In [[Christianity]], they are called [[church]]es. In [[Islam]], they are called [[mosque]]s. People often try to make their religious building as beautiful as possible. Some religious buildings are great works of architecture.

=== Art and music ===
People often make artworks that are about their religion, or that are used in religious celebration, or are put in a religious building. Religious art comes in all shapes and sizes, from tiny pieces of jewellery to huge statues and paintings. Artworks often give important clues to [[historian]]s about different ancient religions that are not well understood.

Music is often important in religious celebrations. Singing, chanting and playing musical instruments are often part of regular religious gatherings of people. Special music is often used on special occasions. Many famous composers have written religious music. The words of songs that are 3,000 years old are used every day in Christian churches and Jewish synagogues.

[[File:The Scientific Universe.png|thumb|350px|The scale of the universe mapped to the branches of science.]]

Science is what we do to find out about the natural world. It is the total of [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]] and [[astronomy]]. Science makes use of [[mathematics]], and it makes [[observation]]s and [[experiment]]s. Science produces accurate [[facts]], scientific laws and [[theories]].<ref name=wilson>Wilson, Edward O. 1998. Consilience: the unity of knowledge. New York: Vintage Books, 49–71. ISBN 0-679-45077-7</ref><ref>Heilbron J.L. 2003. ''The Oxford companion to the history of modern science''. New York: Oxford University Press, vii. ISBN 0-19-511229-6. <br/>"...&nbsp;modern science is a discovery as well as an invention. It was a discovery that nature generally acts regularly enough to be described by laws and even by [[mathematics]]; and required invention to devise the techniques, abstractions, apparatus, and organization for exhibiting the regularities and securing their law-like descriptions".</ref> 'Science' also refers to the large amount of knowledge that has been found using this process.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/science |quote= knowledge or a system of knowledge covering general truths or the operation of general laws especially as obtained and tested through scientific method... |publisher=Merriam-Webster |title=Online dictionary |accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref><ref name="Popper">{{cite book |last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |title=The Logic of Scientific Discovery |origyear=1959 |edition=2nd English edition |year=2002 |publisher=Routledge Classics |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-27844-9 |oclc=59377149 |page=3}}</ref>

[[Research]] uses the [[scientific method]]. Scientific research uses [[hypotheses]] based on ideas or earlier knowledge. Then those hypotheses are tested by [[experiments]].  

People who study and research science and try to find out everything about it are called [[scientist]]s. Scientists [[Research|study]] things by [[see|looking]] at them very carefully, by [[measure|measuring]] them, and by doing [[experiment]]s and [[test]]s. Scientists try to [[wikt:explain|explain]] why things [[act]] the way they do, and [[predict]] what will happen.

== Scientific method ==
Today, "science" usually refers to a way of pursuing [[knowledge]], not just the knowledge itself. It is mainly about the [[phenomena]] of the material world.<ref>Oxford English Dictionary</ref> In the 17th and 18th centuries scientists increasingly sought to formulate knowledge in terms of ''[[scientific law|laws of nature]]'' such as [[Newton's laws of motion]]. And over the course of the 19th century, the word "science" became increasingly associated with the [[scientific method]] itself, as a way to study the natural world, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[geology]] and [[biology]]. 

It is in the 19th century also that the term ''[[scientist]]'' was created by [[William Whewell]]. He meant it to distinguish those who sought knowledge on nature from those who sought other types of knowledge.<ref>The ''Oxford English Dictionary'' dates the origin of the word "scientist" to 1834.</ref>

The [[scientific method]] is the name given to the methods used by scientists to find knowledge. The main [[wikt:feature|feature]]s of the scientific method are:
#Scientists identify a question or a problem about nature. Some problems are simple, such as "how many legs do flies have?" and some are very deep, such as "why do objects fall to the ground?" 
#Next, scientists investigate the problem. They work at it, collecting facts. Sometimes all it takes is to look carefully. 
#Some questions cannot be answered directly. Then scientists suggest ideas, and test them out. They do [[experiment]]s and collect [[data]].
#Eventually, they figure out what they think is a good answer to the problem. Then they tell people about it.
#Later, other scientists may agree or not agree. They may suggest another answer. They may do more experiments. Anything in science might be revised if we find out the previous solution was not good enough.

== Other features of science ==
Not everyone completely agrees about how science works.  Some [[philosopher|philosophers]] and scientists say that scientific theories are only accepted for the time being. They last so long as they are the best explanation. When theories no longer explain the data, they are discarded and replaced. Or, sometimes scientists will make a theory better rather than discard it, or that they will keep on using the theory hoping that it will be made better eventually.
  
Science is a way to get [[knowledge]] by discarding what is not true. 
 
Scientists must be very careful to make explanations that fit well with what they [[Observation|observe]] and [[measure]].  They [[compete]] to provide better explanations.  An explanation might be [[wikt:interesting|interesting]] or [[wikt:pleasing|pleasing]], but if it does not [[agree]] with what other scientists really see and measure, they will try to find a better explanation.

Before a scientific article is [[wikt:publish|published]], other scientists read the article and decide whether the explanations make sense from the data.  This is called [[peer review]].  After articles are published, other scientists will also check if the same experiments, observations or tests produce the same data again.  [[Peer review]] and [[:wikt:repeating|repeating]] [[experiment]]s are the only way to be sure the [[knowledge]] is [[wikt:correct|correct]]. 

Science makes [[models of nature]], [[models of our universe]], and [[medicine]].  There are many different sciences with their own names.  However it is not right to say "science says" any one thing.  Science is a process, not just the [[fact]]s and [[rules]] believed at one time.

:''Some types of [[distillation|distilled]] [[alcohol]]ic [[drink]]s are also called spirits (as a plural, not "''spirit''").''

A spirit is considered to be the part of a [[being]] that is not the body. Other words with the same meanings are [[soul]] and [[ghost]]. When a body is alive, it has a spirit in it. [[Death]] is when the spirit separates from the body. 

[[Christian]]s believe that spirits exist in [[Heaven]] or [[Hell]]. (See [[1 Timothy]] 3:16, 4:1) 

[[Spiritual séance|Spiritualist]]s believe that spirits can talk with people, or change things in the world. Many religions forbid communicating with such spirits in any way, (see [[Leviticus]] 19:31) but a few include this as part of their practice.

Another use of ''spirit'' means the main purpose or [[definition|meaning]] of a sentence or [[wikt:document|document]]. For example, the "spirit of a [[law]]" is the true meaning of the law which the creator wanted. This phrase is often used when the words and sentences of a law could mean more than one thing, but a [[judge]] must decide what meaning is correct.

The Sun is a [[star]]. It contains 99.9 percent of the Solar System's [[mass]]. This means that it has strong [[gravity]]. The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun.

There are eight [[planet]]s in the Solar System. From closest to farthest from the Sun, they are: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]]. The first four planets are called [[terrestrial planet]]s. They are mostly made of [[Rock (geology)|rock]] and [[metal]], and they are mostly [[solid]]. The last four planets are called [[gas giant]]s. This is because they are large planets that are mostly made of [[gas]]. Even though they are made of gas, they have much more mass than the terrestrial planets.

The Solar System also contains other things.  There are [[asteroid]]s, mostly between Mars and Jupiter.  Further out than Neptune, there is the [[Kuiper belt]] and the [[scattered disc]]. These areas have [[dwarf planet]]s, including [[Pluto]]. There are thousands of very small objects in these areas. Also there are also comets, [[Centaur (planetoid)|centaurs]], and there is [[Cosmic dust|interplanetary dust]].

Six of the planets and three of the dwarf planets are orbited by [[Satellite (natural)|moons]]. Furthermore, [[Cosmic dust|planetary dust]] orbits the gas giants. There are many other [[Planetary system|systems]] like the Solar System in the universe. Each star has the potential to have a planetary system. There are more than 200 [[billion]] stars in the [[Milky Way]] [[galaxy]].

== Evolution of the Solar System ==
{{main|Formation and evolution of the Solar System}}
The formation and [[wikt:evolution|evolution]] of the Solar System began 4.6&nbsp;[[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years ago with the [[gravitation]]al collapse of a small part of a giant [[molecular cloud]].<ref>[http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo941.html Bouvier, Audrey and Meenakshi Wadhwa, "The age of the solar system redefined by the oldest Pb-Pb age of a meteoritic inclusion"]. ''Nature Geoscience,'' Nature Publishing Group, a division of Macmillan Publishers Limited. Published online 2010-08-22, retrieved 2010-08-26, doi: 10.1038/NGEO941.<br>Date based on oldest inclusions found to date in [[meteorite]]s, thought to be among the first solid material to form in the collapsing solar nebula.</ref>

Most of the collapsing mass collected in the centre, forming the [[Sun]], while the rest flattened into a protoplanetary [[disk]] of loose dust, out of which the [[planet]]s, [[Natural satellite|moons]], [[asteroid]]s, and other Solar System bodies formed.

This widely accepted model, known as the [[nebula]]r [[hypothesis]], was first developed in the 18th (1700's) century by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]], [[Immanuel Kant]], and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]]. Its subsequent development has interwoven a variety of scientific disciplines including [[astronomy]], [[physics]], [[geology]], and [[planetary science]]. As our knowledge of space has grown, the models have been changed to account for the new observations.

The Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are believed to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, as the [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]], may be the result of [[Giant impact hypothesis|giant collision]]s. 

Many collisions between bodies have occurred, and have been important to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets often shifted, and planets have switched places.<ref name="Gomes">{{cite journal | url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7041/pdf/nature03676.pdf | title=Origin of the cataclysmic Late Heavy Bombardment period of the terrestrial planets | author=R.

== Earth's orbit ==
The [[Earth's orbit]] around the Sun is nearly a perfect circle, but when mapped it is found that the [[Earth]] moves around the Sun in a very slightly oval shaped, called an [[orbit|elliptical orbit]]. The other [[planet]]s in the Solar System also circle the Sun in slightly elliptical orbits. [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]] has a more elliptical orbit than the others, and some of the smaller objects orbit the Sun in very [[orbit|eccentric orbits]].

== Discovery and exploration ==
{{Main|History of astronomy}}
For thousands of years, people had no need for a name for the "Solar System". They thought the Earth stayed still at the center of everything ([[geocentrism]]). Although the Greek philosopher [[Aristarchus of Samos]] suggested that there was a special order in the sky,<ref>{{cite journal|title= The astronomical system of Copernicus|author=WC Rufus|journal=Popular Astronomy|volume=31|pages=510|url=http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1923PA.....31..510R|accessdate=2009-05--09}}</ref> [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] was the first to develop a [[Mathematical model|mathematical system]] that described what we now call the "solar system". This was called a new "system of the world". In the 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]], [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]] began helping people understand [[physics]] more clearly. This made people slowly accept the idea that the Earth is a planet and moves around the Sun, and that the planets are worlds with the same [[physical law]]s that control Earth. More recently, telescopes and spacecraft have led to discoveries of [[mountains]] and [[Impact crater|craters]], and [[season]]al [[meteorology|meteorological]] phenomena such as [[clouds]], [[dust storm]]s and [[ice cap]]s on the other planets.

[[File:Uklad Sloneczny 2006.png|thumb|Planetary distances, not to scale]]

== The eight planets ==
In their order from the Sun:
#[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]
#[[Venus]]
#[[Earth]]
#[[Mars]]
#[[Jupiter]]
#[[Saturn (planet)|Saturn]]
#[[Uranus]]
#[[Neptune]]

The planets are the biggest objects that go around Sun. It took people many years of looking carefully through [[telescope]]s to find the objects that were farthest away. No one expects to find [[Planets beyond Neptune|new planets]], but more small objects are found every year. Most of the planets have [[Satellite (natural)|moons]] that orbit around them just as the planet orbit the Sun. There are at least 173 of these moons in the solar system.

== Dwarf planets ==
{{Main|Dwarf planet}}

[[Pluto]] had been called a planet since it was discovered in 1930, but in 2006 [[astronomer]]s meeting at the [[International Astronomical Union]] decided on the definition of a planet, and Pluto did not fit. Instead they defined a new category of [[dwarf planet]], into which Pluto did fit, along with some others. These small planets are sometimes called [[plutino]]s.

* [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]]
* [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]]
* [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]
* [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]]

== Structure ==
There are a few main parts of the Solar System. Here they are in order from the Sun, with the planets numbered, and the [[dwarf planet]]s marked with the letters a - e.

=== Inner solar system, Outer solar system, Trans-Neptune region ===
[[File:Terrestrial planet size comparisons.jpg|thumb|The inner planets. From left to right: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], and [[Mars]]]]
Sometimes people use alternative names for similar regions defined above. These are less formal, and less well defined.

* <big>Inner solar system</big> contains
:* [[Terrestrial planet]]s
:* [[Asteroid belt]]
* <big>Outer solar system</big> contains
:* [[gas giant|Gas giant planets]]
* <big>Trans-Neptune region</big> contains
:* [[Kuiper belt]]
:* [[Scattered disc]]

The first four planets closest to the Sun are called the inner planets. They are small and dense terrestrial planets, with solid surfaces. They are made up of mostly rock and metal with a distinct internal structure and a similar size. Three also have an [[atmosphere]]. The study of the four planets gives information about [[geology]] outside the Earth.

Sometimes the ''Outer solar system'' is taken to mean the [[gas giant|Gas Giant Planets]], the [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper Belt]], and the [[scattered disc|Scattered Disk]]. But with discoveries of many objects in the [[Kuiper belt|Kuiper Belt]], and the [[scattered disc|Scattered Disk]], and with more dwarf planet discoveries, the ''Outer solar system'' is now usually defined more narrowly.

The Oort cloud is separate from the Trans-Neptune region, and much farther out.

=== Plane of the ecliptic ===
The ''plane of the ecliptic'' is defined by the Earth's orbit around the Sun. All of the planets orbit the Sun roughly around this same plane. The farther away from this plane a planet orbits, the more ''inclined'' is its orbit to the ecliptic. If you could look at the solar system "edge on" then all the planets would be orbiting in the plane of the ecliptic plane.

[[File:Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn 079.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''Moses smashing the Tables of the Law'' is a painting by [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]]]
The Ten Commandments, according to the book of [[Exodus]] in the [[Bible]], are rules for life given by [[God]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] to give to the [[Jew|People of Israel]].<ref>({{bibleverse||Exodus|19:23|HE}}), {{cite web |url=http://www.simpletoremember.com/vitals/G-dAtSinai.htm |title=Did God speak at Mt. Sinai |accessdate=2008-07-21 |format= |work=SimpleToRemember.com }}</ref> Although the Book of [[Deuteronomy]] talks about Mount Horeb,<ref>{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|5:2|HE}}</ref> it is often considered to have been a different name for the same place. The rules were written on stone tablets. These rules are important for [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].

Sometimes these rules are also called Decalogue (from [[Greek language|Greek]], can be translated as ''ten statements''). The name decalogue first occurs in the [[Septuagint]]. The Jews received the commandments after they had left [[Egypt]] during the reign of [[Pharaoh]] [[Ramses]]. There are different [[text]]s talking about the commandments. Most of them are in the [[Bible]]: The Book of [[Exodus]], Chapter 20 and the book of [[Deuteronomy]], Chapter 5. The [[Qu'ran]] mentions the tablets but does not list the commandments.
Because the Bible has been translated many times, there are variations in the way the commandments are written.

== In the Bible ==
The Bible in Basic English<ref>{{cite web |url=http://basicenglishbible.com/exodus/20.htm |title=Exodus 20: Bible in Basic English |accessdate=2008-07-21 |format= |work=BasicEnglishBible.com }}</ref> translates the commandments from Exodus in this way:

* {{sup|1}} And God said all these words: {{sup|2}} I am the Lord took you out of the land of Egypt, out of the prison-house. {{sup|3}} You are to have no other gods but me.
* {{sup|4}} You are not to make an image or picture of anything in heaven or on the earth or in the waters under the earth: {{sup|5}} You may not go down on your faces before them or give them worship: for I, the Lord your God, am a God who will not give his honour to another; and I will send punishment on the children for the wrongdoing of their fathers, to the third and fourth generation of my haters; {{sup|6}} And I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws.
* {{sup|7}} You are not to make use of the name of the Lord your God for an evil purpose; whoever takes the Lord's name on his lips for an evil purpose will be judged a sinner by the Lord
* {{sup|8}} Keep in memory the Sabbath and let it be a holy day. {{sup|9}} On six days do all your work: {{sup|10}} But the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God; on that day you are to do no work, you or your son or your daughter, your man-servant or your woman-servant, your cattle or the man from a strange country who is living among you: {{sup|11}} For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and the sea, and everything in them, and he took his rest on the seventh day: for this reason the Lord has given his blessing to the seventh day and made it holy.
* {{sup|12}} Give honour to your father and to your mother, so that your life may be long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
* {{sup|13}} Do not put anyone to death without cause.
* {{sup|14}} Do not be false to the married relation.
* {{sup|15}} Do not take the property of another.
* {{sup|16}} Do not give false witness against your neighbour.
* {{sup|17}} Let not your desire be turned to your neighbour's house, or his wife or his man-servant or his woman-servant or his ox or his ass or anything which is his.

==Differences in teachings and interpretation==
These commandments are translated from ancient [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] to [[Basic English]], so the exact words chosen may not mean to us exactly what they meant to the Hebrews. There are a variety of interpretations of these commandments:
;Images

[[File:Sun and Moon creation.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''The Creation of the Sun and the Moon'' is a [[fresco]] in the [[Sistine Chapel]]. It was done by [[Michelangelo]]. It shows an image of God.]]

One understanding on the commandment to not make "any image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above" is as from [[Roman Catholicism]]: they hold that "likenesses" may be built and used, as long as the object is not [[worship]]ped. The [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] has a very similar position. Eastern Orthodoxy teaches that the [[incarnation]] of an [[visible spectrum|invisible]] God as a visible human, Jesus, makes it alright to worship images (see [[Iconoclasm]]). But, for Jews, Muslims, and most other Christians that violates the commandment.

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] criticize the use of all of the above, as well as the use of the cross. The [[Amish]] forbid any sort of image, such as [[photography|photos]].

;Sabbath day
{{main|Sabbath|Shabbat}}

Jews honor the Sabbath ''(Shabbat)'' on Saturday, the seventh day of the week on the [[Hebrew calendar|Jewish calendar]].

Most [[Christians]] honor the Sabbath on Sunday to remember the [[Resurrection]] of Jesus on the first day of the week on the Jewish calendar.

Some conservative Christians are "Sabbatarians" (most of these follow the [[Reformation|Reformed]] [[tradition]]s). Sabbatarians think the first day of the week or ''Lord's Day'' is the new Sabbath, because the 4th commandment has never been [[revoke]]d and Sabbath-keeping is in any case a creation [[ordinance]].

Others believe that the Sabbath remains as a day of rest on Saturday, while Sunday as a day of worship, in reference to Acts 20:7: the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread and to hear the preaching of the apostle Paul. Also, Jesus appeared to his followers on the "first day of the week" while they were in hiding.

The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], and some others, believe that the custom of meeting for worship on Sunday originated in [[paganism]], specifically [[Sol Invictus]] and [[Mithraism]] (in which [[sun]] [[god]] worship took place on Sunday). Instead, Adventists keep Saturday as the Sabbath as a memorial to God's work of creation<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|2:1-3|9}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|20:8-11|9}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|16:23,29-30|9}}</ref> believing that none of the Ten Commandments can ever be destroyed.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|5:17-19|9}}, {{bibleverse||Exodus|31:16|9}}</ref> Seventh-day Sabbatarians claim that the seventh day Sabbath was kept by the majority of Christian groups until the [[2nd century|2nd]] and [[3rd century]], but because of opposition to Judaism after the [[Jewish-Roman wars]], the original custom was gradually replaced by Sunday as the day of worship.

;Married relations

To "be false to the married relation", called [[adultery]], is when a married person has [[sexual intercourse|sexual relations]] with a person other than his or her spouse. The Bible does not say whether or not this includes unmarried people having sex with each other, although some people think so.

;Killing or murder

There are different [[translation]]s of this commandment; the Hebrew words {{lang|he|לא תרצח}} are translated either as "thou shalt not kill" or "thou shalt not murder". Older Protestant translations of the Bible, those based on the [[Vulgate]] and Roman Catholic translations usually translate it "Thou shalt not [[kill]]". Jewish and newer Protestant versions tend to use "You shall not [[murder]]". There are different opinions as to which translation is more faithful to the original.

The many examples in the Old Testament of killing sanctioned by God, are quoted in defense of the view that "murder" is more accurate.  Furthermore, the Hebrew word for "kill" is "{{lang|he|הרג}}" - "''harog''", while the Hebrew word for "murder" is "{{lang|he|רצח}}" - "''retzach''", which is found in the Ten Commandments "{{lang|he|לא תרצח}}" - "''lo tirtzach''".

In the [[New Testament]], [[Jesus]] talked about who was guilty of breaking these commandments. He said that even if someone was just angry and rude to another person, he might be judged for murder, and if he just looked with desire or [[lust]] at a woman, he had committed adultery in his heart.<ref>{{bibleverse||Matthew|5:28|9}}</ref>

;Stealing

Many [[Theology|theologians]] (such as German Old Testament scholar A. Alt: ''Das Verbot des Diebstahls im Dekalog'' (1953)) suggest that commandment "you shall not steal" was originally intended against stealing people—abductions and [[slavery]]. This would be the same as the Jewish interpretation of the statement as "you shall not kidnap" (e.g. as stated by Rashi).

;False witness

To "give false witness" called [[lying]], may include all lying, or only lying in court, which is called [[perjury]].

=== Different numbering ===
The Bible does not number the commandments. Different religious groups have numbered them in different ways. The Jews, followed by Christian [[Protestant]]s, end the first commandment with "You are to have no other gods but me." as above. [[Catholic]]s and [[Lutheran]]s end the first commandment at "I will have mercy through a thousand generations on those who have love for me and keep my laws." and separate in their last two commandments the desire for a man's wife from the desire for other things he owns.

The commandments passage in Exodus has more than ten important statements, there are 14 or 15 in all. While the Bible itself gives the count as "10", using the Hebrew phrase ''ʻaseret had'varim''—translated as ''the 10 words'', ''statements'' or ''things'', this phrase does not appear in the passages usually presented as being "the Ten Commandments".<ref>{{bibleverse|Exodus||34:28|HE}}, {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy||4:13|HE}}, {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy||10:4|HE}}</ref> Various religions divide the commandments differently.

== Muslim understanding ==
[[Islam]] teaches that the Bible is a revelation from God but the text used in Judaism and Christianity has been corrupted. The Ten Commandments are not explicitly mentioned in the [[Qur'an]] but each is implied by the following verses in the Quran.

# "There is no other god beside God."({{cite quran|47|19|style=ref}})
# "My Lord, make this a peaceful land, and protect me and my children from worshiping idols." ({{cite quran|14|35|style=ref}})
# "Do not subject God's name to your casual swearing, that you may appear righteous, pious, or to get credibility among the people." ({{cite quran|2|224|style=ref}})
# "O you who believe, when the Congregational Prayer (Salat Al-Jumu`ah) is announced on Friday, you shall hasten to the commemoration of GOD, and drop all business." ({{cite quran|62|9|style=ref}})<ref>The Sabbath was abandoned with the revelation of the Quran. Muslims are told in the Quran that the Sabbath was only decreed for the Jews. ({{cite quran|16|124|style=ref}}) God, however, ordered Muslims to make every effort and drop all businesses to attend the congregational (Friday) prayer. The Submitters may tend to their business during the rest of the day.</ref>
# "....and your parents shall be honored. As long as one or both of them live, you shall never say to them, "Uff" (the slightest gesture of annoyance), nor shall you shout at them; you shall treat them amicably." ({{cite quran|17|23|style=ref}})
# "....anyone who murders any person who had not committed murder or horrendous crimes, it shall be as if he murdered all the people." (5:32)
# "You shall not commit adultery; it is a gross sin, and an evil behavior." ({{cite quran|17|32|style=ref}})
# "The thief, male or female, you shall mark their hands as a punishment for their crime, and to serve as an example from God.  God is Almighty, Most Wise." ({{cite quran|5|38|39|style=ref}})
# "Do not withhold any testimony by concealing what you had witnessed. Anyone who withholds a testimony is sinful at heart." ({{cite quran|2|283|style=ref}})
# "And do not want what we bestowed upon any other people. Such are temporary ornaments of this life, whereby we put them to the test. What your Lord provides for you is far better, and everlasting." ({{cite quran|20|131|style=ref}})

== Other religions ==
In general, religions other than those mentioned (Judaism, Christianity, Islam) do not recognise the Ten Commandments as [[Ethics|ethical standards]]. Many of them ([[Buddhism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], etc.) have similar laws or principles though.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unification.org/ucbooks/WorldScr/WS-02-03.htm|title=World Scripture: The Decalogue by Andrew Wilson|accessdate=2008-01-26}}</ref>
In the [[atheist]] [[Soviet Union]] the [[Moral Code of the Builder of Communism]] was a set of rules that resembled the Ten Commandments.

==The Ritual Decalogue==

The term "Ten Commandments" generally applies to the list mentioned in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5. However, there is a continuous story being told starting in Exodus 31:18 (where the stones are created), Exodus 32:19 (where the tablets are broken) and Exodus 34. This story lists a very different set of commandments. This version is sometimes called "Ritual Decalogue". [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and the people after him who followed the [[documentary hypothesis]], note that Exodus 34:28 seems to refer to these Ten Commandments rather than the traditional ones. These people thought that the commandments in Exodus 20 and Deuteronomy 5 show a later set of Ten Commandments, and that the ten listed in Exodus 34 were the original Ten Commandments, now known as the ''Ritual Decalogue'' (as opposed to the better-known "Ethical Decalogue"). The differences between the two Decalogues highlight the development of sacred texts over a long time and from differing narrative traditions by incorporating two differing sets of Ten Commandments.

The commandments have influenced Jewish [[ethics]] and [[law]] and, through [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]], Western [[ethics]] and [[law]] since the [[Roman Empire]].<ref>*{{Cite book|last= Coogan |first= Michael |year= 2014 |title= The Ten Commandments; A Short History of an Ancient Text |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |isbn=9780300178715}}</ref>  Moses is the founder of basis of the philosophy of law as well as such modern legal doctrines as independent judiciary and separation of powers.<ref>Barenboim Peter, [http://www.florentine-society.ru/pdf/Biblical_Roots_of_Separation_of_Powers.pdf ''Biblical Roots of Separation of Powers'', Moscow, Letny Sad, 2005].

==In the Arts==
===Film===
There have been two famous films of this name; both were directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], a silent movie in 1923, and a movie in 1956, starring [[Charlton Heston]] as Moses. That one was the biggest money-making movie that year.

A temple is a building where people go to practice their [[religion]]. In a temple people may perform religious [[ritual]]s, [[ceremony|ceremonies]], and [[pray]]. Thus, a temple is a general term for a house of [[worship]]. [[Christianity|Christians]] usually call their religious buildings [[church|churches]].

Some examples of temples from different religions:
*[[Hinduism]] ([[Mandir]])
*[[Buddhism]] ([[Shaolin]])
*[[Temples at Uppsala]]
*[[Greek temple]]
*[[Temple in Jerusalem]]
*[[Mormon]] [[Mormon temple|temple]]

[[File:A lecture at the University of West London, Ealing Campus.jpg|thumb|280px|A lecture at the University of West London.]]
A university is an institution where teaching and research is done. The word ''university'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''universitas magistrorum et scholarium'', roughly meaning "community of teachers and [[academia|scholars]]." <ref>[http://books.google.com/books?id=5vgGE8_CGOEC&pg=PA748&lpg=PA748&dq=community+of+teachers+and+scholars+universitas+magistrorum+et+scholarium&source=web&ots=Q-K88OdXyH&sig=YqFluZHNcSWstv1oApgs34cMUdQ Google eBook of ''Encyclopedia Britannica'']</ref> People can attend university to get a degree. Unlike the schooling they have done before, the courses at university are specialized. A person studying [[biology]] at university has lots of courses about biology and not very many courses in other fields, like languages or history. To get a higher degree, people must do some research.

== History ==
[[File:Bologna-vista02.jpg|thumb|Area above the old [[University of Bologna]] buildings, founded in 1088]]
The universities were born in Europe during the [[Middle Ages]]. The first institution of this type was the [[University of Bologna]] that later became a model for similar centers of education.<ref>Hunt Janin: "The university in medieval life, 1179–1499", McFarland, 2008, ISBN 0-7864-3462-7, p. 55f.</ref><ref>de Ridder-Symoens, Hilde: [http://books.google.com/books?id=5Z1VBEbF0HAC&printsec=frontcover ''A History of the University in Europe: Volume 1, Universities in the Middle Ages''], Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-36105-2, pp. 47–55</ref><ref>{{cite book | url=http://books.google.com/books?id=wyjnHZ1IIlgC|title=The Challenge of Bologna| author=Paul L. Gaston | year=2010 | pages=18 | isbn=1-57922-366-4}}</ref> This term can often be used in other cultures to mean centers of higher education and higher thought, although their creation was often well before the Middle Ages.

At first, the universities had formed themselves according to the model of the professional groups and like almost everything in the Middle Ages, they remained tied to the [[Catholic Church]]. At the beginning, they had worked to teach the so-called "seven [[liberal arts]]" (the ''trivium'' and the ''quadrivium''):
* ''Trivium'': [[grammar]], [[logic]] and [[rhetoric]].
* ''Quadrivium'': [[arithmetic]] and [[geometry]], [[astronomy]] and [[music]].
That earliest division caused the present divisions between literary and scientific fields.

== Organization ==
A university can include several [[campus]]es, or different places where classes are taught. In each campus there are several [[faculty|faculties]] and university schools (mainly for teaching), and also laboratories, departments and institutes of research. Many campuses also have housing for students in buildings called dormitories and structures like libraries, study rooms, and gymnasiums for students that live there. Each school offers many courses that students take to earn a degree.
The person with the highest right to control and to command in a university is the rector, who governs the university with the help of the party of vice-rectors and of other organs such as the social council and the governing body.

:''"The Web" redirects here. For other uses, see [[Web (disambiguation)]]''.

The World Wide Web ("WWW" or "The Web") is the part of the [[Internet]] that contains [[website]]s and [[webpage]]s. It was invented in 1989 by [[Tim Berners-Lee]] at [[CERN]], [[Geneva City|Geneva]], [[Switzerland]]. Sir Tim Berners-Lee created a new [[webpage]] called [[yahoo an|HTML]]. Websites are composed of pages linked by hypertext links. They are all written in the HTML page.

The World Wide Web is used to describe HTML webpages that are part of the Internet. 

In order to see the World Wide Web one needs a [[Tablet computer|computer]], and a modem. One also needs a connection to the [[Internet]].

Many companies nowadays offer limited [[Web hosting service|website hosting]] allowing one to make websites that can be displayed on the World Wide Web like any other [[Domain name|domain]] (www.stuff.com) site. These sites usually make money from [[advertisement]]s instead of [[fee]]s.

[[File:Www.wikipedia.org screenshot 2013.png|thumb|250px|This is a screenshot of a website. The website in this picture is [http://www.wikipedia.org wikipedia.org].]]

A website is a set of [[webpage]]s that are joined together. People look at websites with a [[computer]] of some kind, sometimes including the computer inside [[mobile telephone]]s and [[television]]s. The websites are kept on computers called [[web server]]s.

== Structure ==
=== Homepage ===
There is almost always a single [[homepage]] which has [[link]]s to other pages that are part of that "site". Sometimes it has links to pages that are part of other "sites" as well. (Note that [[net jargon]] uses the word [[site]], which also means a physical place in the real world, to mean a [[World Wide Web|web]] [[URL]]). A home page serves as the [[wikt:introduction|introduction]] page of a website.

=== Uses ===
Websites can be used to [[advertise]] or sell things. They can also be used to talk to other people. A [[blog]] is a website where the location of the material is less relevant than who writes it, and which is more focused on dialogue. Very often the people who use blogs dislike the word "site" since it implies a controlled place. Sites are good for looking up [[information]] on the computer.

== Types of websites ==
* [[Weblog]] ''(or also known as blog)''
* [[Wiki]] ''(A website where anyone can edit the pages)''
* [[Content Management System]] ''(A piece of internet software that can edit web pages through a [[WYSIWYG]] editor)''
* [[Search engine]] ''(A website like [[Google]], which you can use to search the web)''
* [[Social networking]] sites ''(Like [[Facebook]], which allows you to interact with friends)''

== Access ==
Users can access any website by using a [[URL]]. This is the website address which is shown near the top of the web browser. The homepage and the rest of the site usually have the same words at the start of the URL — for instance, pages at the Simple English Wikipedia always start "http://simple.wikipedia.org/..." but are different after that. However if a person does not buy a [[domain name]] the website could be an [[IP Address]] which for example could be (127.0.0.1)

== Appearance ==
Web sites are usually shown in [[HTML]] (Hyper Text Markup Language) but are not always written or kept that way - some use [[WAP]] and others use [[XML]].

== Website builder software ==
This is usually a collection of software tools that allow the construction of websites without manual code editing.<ref name=Peri251>Peri Pakroo; Marcia Stewart, ''Small Business Start-Up Kit, The: A Step-by-Step Legal Guide'' (Berkeley, CA: Nolo, 2014), p. 251</ref> Several hosted website services have website builder software built-in.<ref name=Peri251/>

A wiki is a type of [[website]] that lets anyone who can access the wiki create and change its [[webpage|pages]]. The word is [[Internet slang]]. The word ''Wiki'' is short for WikiWikiWeb. ''Wikiwiki'' is a word from the [[Hawaiian language]], meaning "fast" or "[[speed]]".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-09-19 | url=http://www.mauimapp.com/moolelo/hwnwdshw.htm | title=Hawaiian Words; Hawaiian to English | publisher=mauimapp.com | work=Maui Island Guide | accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref> Examples of wikis include [[Wikipedia]], [[Citizendium]], and [[Conservapedia]].

Every wiki can be changed, or edited, by anyone who has an account on the wiki, or by everyone in the world if the wiki allows anonymous access, although some important pages cannot be changed by anyone. Wikis are central places where we all can share information with each other, people can add new information, and then people read them. Wikis allow information from all around the world to be collected.

On a wiki, people can write pages together to add to the information. If one person writes something wrong, then the next person can correct it. The next person can also add something new to the page. Because of this, the page gets better whenever someone changes it. If someone writes information that is very obviously wrong, and the person actually was to vandalise, it would be changed by administrators, and the person will not be able to change the wiki anymore. Pages are watched closely. 

Users can also discuss things on wikis. [[Discussion]] can help people understand things better, or gives people a chance to tell their views. In Wikipedia the talk pages are for that, but in some wikis, the article and the discussion are in the same page.

Wikis can be used for different things; not all wikis follow the same rules for using them. For example, the purpose of Wikipedia is to write [[article]]s, for an [[encyclopedia]]. That is why in Wikipedia, people do not want to hear general discussion that does not help in writing articles.

[[Ward Cunningham]] started the first wiki in March 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiWikiWeb |title=Wiki Wiki Web |first= |last= |work=c2.com |year=2011 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.re-public.gr/en/?p=141 |title=Wiki and the rise of gift economies|first=Ward |last=Cunningham |work=Re-imagining democracy |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=10 November 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Blogs, Wikis, Podcasts, and Other Powerful Web Tools for Classrooms|last=Richardson|first=Bill|publisher=Corwin Press|date=2008|page=p.60|isbn=1412959713}}</ref> Many people liked the place and wrote there, after which they started similar websites. Wiki is also an abbreviation for Wikipedia.

== Vandalism ==
A wiki is freely editable by anyone. Some wikis are even available to people without an account, so wikis are the best targets for vandals to add bad content to because it is easy for them to save the page. There are many ways to prevent this. Like protecting the page to only allow registered users to edit or simply block them if they go out of hand.

There is no way to stop vandalism totally, but it is possible to lower the number of vandals of the wiki.

== Types of wiki software ==

* [[Dokuwiki]]
* [[Phpwiki]]
* [[Pmwiki]]
* [[Tikiwiki]]
* [[Wikkawiki]]
* [[JSPWiki]]

A computer program is a list of [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] that tell a [[computer]] what to do. Everything a computer does is done by using a computer program. 

Some examples of computer programs:
* A [[web browser]] like [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Apple Safari]] can be used to view [[web page]]s on the [[Internet]].
* An [[office suite]] can be used to write [[wikt:document|document]]s or [[spreadsheet]]s.
* [[Video games]] are computer programs, too. 

A computer program is stored as a [[Computer file|file]] on the computer's [[hard drive]]. When the [[wikt:user|user]] runs the program, the file is read by the computer, and the [[processor]] reads the data in the file as a list of [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]]. Then the computer does what the program tells it to do.

A computer program is written by a [[programmer]]. It is very difficult to write in [[binary|ones and zeroes]], which is what the computer can read, so computer programmers write in a [[programming language]], such as [[BASIC]], [[C (programming language)|C]], or [[Java (programming language)|Java]]. Once it is written, the programmer uses a [[compiler]] to turn it into a language that the computer can understand.

There are also bad programs, called [[malware]], written by people who want to do bad things to a computer. Some are [[spyware]], trying to steal information from the computer. Some try to damage the data stored on the [[hard drive]]. Some others send users to [[web site]]s that offer to sell them things. Some are [[computer virus]]es.
