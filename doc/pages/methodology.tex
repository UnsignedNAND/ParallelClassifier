\section{Introduction}
In the first section of this chapter the significance of the project is briefly explained. Then, according to it, the work plan is presented in the second section.  In next sections designed algorithms are described taking into consideration the possibility to provide a framework for text document categorization in parallel environment. 

\section{Significance}
Data mining algorithms play an essential role not only in business and science applications but also in medicine as second-opinion diagnostic tools. On the other hand, nowadays text documents become more and more accessible, because of digitalization of information. Taking it into consideration there is a strong need to find a tool which allows to speed up information lookup by classifying given document with certain confidence of accuracy in relevance to the set of other documents. This solution based on using data mining algorithms in parallel environment can doubtless have a wide range of applications. The motivation for this work is to provide algorithms for documents features extraction, documents clasterization and classification. Next step is to scale this solution into application based on parallel processing. This combination may lead to previously undiscovered system that allows to accelerate   document classification significantly. Many new aspects analyzed and defined in this paper may turned out to be important in the future researches and significant for development in many areas, for example:
\begin{enumerate}

\item spam filtering

\item email routing

\item language identification


\end{enumerate}


\section{Work plan}

According to results that should be achieved, the plan of the project is divided into following parts:

\begin{enumerate}

\item Task 1 Implementation and validation of algorithms for feature extraction

\item  Task 2 Development and validation of algorithms for documents clusterization and specyfing documents groups based on testing data set

\item  Task 3 Development and validation of algorithms for
 new document classification

\item  Task 4 Analyzing collected data and validating accuracy of used methods

\item Task 5 Development and validation of algorithms for parallel processing 

\item  Task 6 Analyzing collected data and validating accuracy of parallel processing algorithms



\end{enumerate}
